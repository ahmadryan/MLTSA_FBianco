[The Tyranny of Simple Explanations](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/08/occams-razor/495332/) - a popular science piece against Ockham's Razor
The history of science has been distorted by a longstanding conviction that correct theories about nature are always the most elegant ones.

# Assignment:

Follow instruction on [ARIMA_instructions.ipynb](ARIMA_instructions.ipynb)

Note that there are severl helper notebooks: in [CodeExamples](https://github.com/fedhere/MLTSA_FBianco/tree/master/CodeExamples) there are notebooks to load data from Kaggle (which also includes a differenciation function) and in [CodeExamples/ARMA](https://github.com/fedhere/MLTSA_FBianco/tree/master/CodeExamples/ARMA) notebooks to plot autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions.
The partial solution to read in the kaggle dataset into a single dataframe is also in the [slides](https://slides.com/federicabianco/mltsa2/live?context=editing#/14/1)
