A rhombus tiling of a hexagon is said to be centered if it contains the central lozenge. We compute the number of vertically symmetric rhombus tilings of a hexagon with side lengths $a, b, a, a, b, a$ which are centered. When $a$ is odd and $b$ is even, this shows that the probability that a random vertically symmetric rhombus tiling of a $a, b, a, a, b, a$ hexagon is centered is exactly the same as the probability that a random rhombus tiling of a $a, b, a, a, b, a$ hexagon is centered. This also leads to a factorization theorem for the number of all rhombus tilings of a hexagon which are centered. Let $A$ be a nonempty finite subset of an additive abelian group $G$. Define $A + A := \\\\{a + b : a, b \\\\in A\\\\}$ and $A \\\\dotplus A := \\\\{a + b : a, b \\\\in A~\\\\text{and}~ a \\\\neq b\\\\}$. The set $A$ is called a {\\\\em sum-dominant (SD) set} if $|A + A| > |A - A|$, and it is called a {\\\\em restricted sum-domonant (RSD) set} if $|A \\\\dotplus A| > |A - A|$. In this paper, we prove that for infinitely many positive integers $k$, there are infinitely many RSD sets of integers of cardinality $k$. We also provide an explicit construction of infinite sequence of RSD sets. Can we determine a spin parameter of a black hole by observation of a black hole shadow in an accretion disk? In order to answer this question, we make a qualitative analysis and a quantitative analysis of a shape and a position of a black hole shadow casted by a rotating black hole on an optically thick accretion disk and its dependence on an angular momentum of a black hole. We have found black hole shadows with a quite similar size and a shape for largely different black hole spin parameters and a same black hole mass. Thus, it is practically difficult to determine a spin parameter of a black hole from a size and a shape of a black hole shadow in an accretion disk. We newly introduce a bisector axis of a black hole shadow named a shadow axis. For a rotating black hole a shape and a position of a black hole shadow are not symmetric with respect to a rotation axis of a black hole shadow. So, in this case the minimum interval between a mass center of a black hole and a shadow axis is finite. An extent of this minimum interval is roughly proportional to a spin parameter of a black hole for a fixed inclination angle between a rotation axis of a black hole and a direction of an observer. In order to measure a spin parameter of a black hole, if a shadow axis is determined observationally, it is crucially important to determine a position of a mass center of a black hole in a region of a black hole shadow. In this paper, we find the greatest values $\\\\alpha_{1}$, $\\\\alpha_{2}$, $\\\\alpha_{3}$, $\\\\alpha_{4}$, $\\\\alpha_{5}$, $\\\\alpha_{6}$, $\\\\alpha_{7}$, $\\\\alpha_{8}$ and the least values $\\\\beta_{1}$, $\\\\beta_{2}$, $\\\\beta_{3}$, $\\\\beta_{4}$, $\\\\beta_{5}$, $\\\\beta_{6}$, $\\\\beta_{7}$, $\\\\beta_{8}$ such that the double inequalities $$A^{\\\\alpha_{1}}(a,b)G^{1-\\\\alpha_{1}}(a,b)<N_{GA}(a,b)<A^{\\\\beta_{1}}(a,b)G^{1-\\\\beta_{1}}(a,b),$$ $$\\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{2}}{G(a,b)}+\\\\frac{1-\\\\alpha_{2}}{A(a,b)}<\\\\frac{1}{N_{GA}(a,b)}<\\\\frac{\\\\beta_{2}}{G(a,b)}+\\\\frac{1-\\\\beta_{2}}{A(a,b)},$$ $$A^{\\\\alpha_{3}}(a,b)G^{1-\\\\alpha_{3}}(a,b)<N_{AG}(a,b)<A^{\\\\beta_{3}}(a,b)G^{1-\\\\beta_{3}}(a,b),$$ $$\\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{4}}{G(a,b)}+\\\\frac{1-\\\\alpha_{4}}{A(a,b)}<\\\\frac{1}{N_{AG}(a,b)}<\\\\frac{\\\\beta_{4}}{G(a,b)}+\\\\frac{1-\\\\beta_{4}}{A(a,b)},$$ $$Q^{\\\\alpha_{5}}(a,b)A^{1-\\\\alpha_{5}}(a,b)<N_{AQ}(a,b)<Q^{\\\\beta_{5}}(a,b)A^{1-\\\\beta_{5}}(a,b),$$ $$\\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{6}}{A(a,b)}+\\\\frac{1-\\\\alpha_{6}}{Q(a,b)}<\\\\frac{1}{N_{AQ}(a,b)}<\\\\frac{\\\\beta_{6}}{A(a,b)}+\\\\frac{1-\\\\beta_{6}}{Q(a,b)},$$ $$Q^{\\\\alpha_{7}}(a,b)A^{1-\\\\alpha_{7}}(a,b)<N_{QA}(a,b)<Q^{\\\\beta_{7}}(a,b)A^{1-\\\\beta_{7}}(a,b),$$ $$\\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{8}}{A(a,b)}+\\\\frac{1-\\\\alpha_{8}}{Q(a,b)}<\\\\frac{1}{N_{QA}(a,b)}<\\\\frac{\\\\beta_{8}}{A(a,b)}+\\\\frac{1-\\\\beta_{8}}{Q(a,b)}$$ hold for all $a, b>0$ with $a\\\\neq b$, where $G$, $A$ and $Q$ are respectively the geometric, arithmetic and quadratic means, and $N_{GA}$, $N_{AG}$, $N_{AQ}$ and $N_{QA}$ are the Neuman means derived from the Schwab-Borchardt mean. The paper presents a criterion for a C*-algebra to be a coefficient algebra associated with a given endomorphism In this paper, we define the singular Hochschild cohomology groups $HH_{sg}^i(A, A)$ of an associative $k$-algebra $A$ as morphisms from $A$ to $A[i]$ in the singular category $D_{sg}(A\\\\otimes_k A^{op})$ for $i\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}$. We prove that $HH_{sg}^*(A, A)$ has a Gerstenhaber algebra structure and in the case of a symmetric algebra $A$, $HH_{sg}^*(A, A)$ is a Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebra. In a ring $A$ an ideal $I$ is called (principally) nilary if for any two (principal) ideals $V, W$ in $A$ with $VW\\\\subseteq I,$ then either $V^n\\\\subseteq I$ or $W^m\\\\subseteq I,$ for some positive integers $m$ and $n$ depending on $V$ and $W;$ a ring $A$ is called (principally) nilary if the zero ideal is a (principally) nilary ideal~\\\\cite{Birkenmeier2013133}. Let $G$ be a group and $A$ be a ring with unity. It is natural to ask when the group ring $A[G]$ is a (principally) nilary ring. We proved that, if $A[G]$ is a (principally) nilary ring, then the ring $A$ is a (principally) nilary ring; also, we proved that if $A[G]$ is a (principally) nilary ring and $G$ is a torsion group, then $A$ is a (principally) nilary ring and $G$ is a $p$-group and $p$ is nilpotent in $A;$ the converse, let $G$ be an abelian or locally finite group, if $A$ is a principally nilary ring and $G$ is a $p$-group and $p$ is nilpotent in $A$ then $A[G]$ is a principally nilary ring. Also, for a finite group $G,$ we proved that, $A[G]$ is a (principally) nilary ring iff $A$ is a (principally) nilary ring and $G$ is a $p$-group and $p$ is nilpotent in $A.$ Finally, we show that if $F$ is a field of prime characteristic $p$ and $G$ is a finite (abelian or locally finite) $p$-group, then the group algebra $F[G]$ is a (principally) nilary ring. In this paper, we prove that the inequalities $\\\\alpha [1/3 Q(a,b)+2/3 A(a,b)]+(1-\\\\alpha)Q^{1/3}(a,b)A^{2/3}(a,b)<M(a,b) <\\\\beta [1/3 Q(a,b)+2/3 A(a,b)]+(1-\\\\beta)Q^{1/3}(a,b)A^{2/3}(a,b)$ and $\\\\lambda [1/6 C(a,b)+5/6 A(a,b)]+(1-\\\\lambda)C^{1/6}(a,b)A^{5/6}(a,b)<M(a,b)<\\\\mu [1/6 C(a,b)+5/6 A(a,b)]++(1-\\\\mu)C^{1/6}(a,b)A^{5/6}(a,b)$ hold for all $a,b>0$ with $a\\\\neq b$ if and only if $\\\\alpha\\\\leq (3-3\\\\sqrt[6]{2}\\\\log(1+\\\\sqrt{2}))/[(2+\\\\sqrt{2}-3\\\\sqrt[6]{2})\\\\log(1+\\\\sqrt{2})]=0.777...$, $\\\\beta\\\\geq 4/5$, $\\\\lambda\\\\leq (6-6\\\\sqrt[6]{2}\\\\log(1+\\\\sqrt{2}))/(7-6\\\\sqrt[6]{2}\\\\log(1+\\\\sqrt{2}))=0.274...$, and $\\\\mu\\\\geq 8/25$. Here, $M(a,b)$, $A(a,b)$, $C(a,b)$, and $Q(a,b)$ denote the Neuman-S\\\\\\'{a}ndor, arithmetic, contra-harmonic, and quadratic means of $a$ and $b$, respectively. If $A$ is a $\\\\sigma$-unital $C^*$-algebra and $a$ is a strictly positive element of $A$ then for every compact subset $K$ of the complete regularization $\\\\mathrm{Glimm}(A)$ of $\\\\mathrm{Prim}(A)$ there exists $\\\\alpha > 0$ such that $K\\\\subset \\\\{G\\\\in \\\\mathrm{Glimm}(A) \\\\mid \\\\|a + G\\\\|\\\\geq \\\\alpha\\\\}$. This extends a 1974 result of J. Dauns to all $\\\\sigma$-unital $C^*$-algebras. However, there is a $C^*$-algebra $A$ and a compact subset of $\\\\mathrm{Glimm}(A)$ that is not contained in any set of the form $\\\\{G\\\\in \\\\mathrm{Glimm}(A) \\\\mid \\\\|a + G\\\\|\\\\geq \\\\alpha\\\\}$, $a\\\\in A$ and $\\\\alpha > 0$. To a given nonsingular triangular matrix A with entries from a ring, we associate a weighted bipartite graph G(A) and give a combinatorial description of the inverse of A by employing paths in G(A). Under a certain condition, nonsingular triangular matrices A such that A and A^{-1} have the same zero-nonzero pattern are characterized. A combinatorial construction is given to construct outer inverses of the adjacency matrix of a weighted tree. Let $A$ be an associative commutative algebra with $1$ over a field of zero characteristic, $\\\\{,\\\\} : A \\\\times A \\\\to A$ is a Poisson bracket, $Z = \\\\{ a \\\\in A \\\\mid \\\\{a, A\\\\} = (0) \\\\}.$ We prove that if $A$ is simple as a Poisson algebra then the Lie algebra $\\\\frac{\\\\{A,A\\\\}}{\\\\{A,A\\\\}\\\\cap Z}$ is simple. In this paper, we present the best possible parameters $\\\\alpha_i, \\\\beta_i\\\\ (i=1,2,3)$ and $\\\\alpha_4,\\\\beta_4\\\\in(1/2,1)$ such that the double inequalities \\\\begin{align*} \\\\alpha_1Q(a,b)+(1-\\\\alpha_1)C(a,b)&<AG_{Q,C}(a,b)<\\\\beta_1Q(a,b)+(1-\\\\beta_1)C(a,b),\\\\\\\\ \\\\qquad\\\\ Q^{\\\\alpha_2}(a,b)C^{1-\\\\alpha_2}(a,b)&<AG_{Q,C}(a,b)<Q^{\\\\beta_2}(a,b)C^{1-\\\\beta_2}(a,b),\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{Q(a,b)C(a,b)}{\\\\alpha_3Q(a,b)+(1-\\\\alpha_3)C(a,b)}&<AG_{Q,C}(a,b)<\\\\frac{Q(a,b)C(a,b)}{\\\\beta_3Q(a,b)+(1-\\\\beta_3)C(a,b)},\\\\\\\\ C\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha_4a^2+(1-\\\\alpha_4)b^2},\\\\sqrt{(1-\\\\alpha_4)a^2+\\\\alpha_4b^2}\\\\right)&<AG_{Q,C}(a,b)<C\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{\\\\beta_4a^2+(1-\\\\beta_4)b^2},\\\\sqrt{(1-\\\\beta_4)a^2+\\\\beta_4b^2}\\\\right) \\\\end{align*} hold for all $a, b>0$ with $a\\\\neq b$, where $Q(a,b)$, $C(a,b)$ and $AG(a,b)$ are the quadratic, contraharmonic and Arithmetic-Geometric means, and $AG_{Q,C}(a,b)=AG[Q(a,b),C(a,b)]$. As consequences, we present new bounds for the complete elliptic integral of the first kind. Keywords: Arithmetic-Geometric mean, Complete elliptic integral, Quadratic mean, Contraharmonic mean We examine maps between noncommutative projective spaces. A surjection of graded rings A-->A/J induces a closed immersion Proj(A/J)-->Proj(A). A homomorphism f:A-->B between graded rings induces an affine map U --> Proj(A) from a non-empty open subspace U of Proj(B). If A^{(n)} is the n-th Veronese subalgebra of a graded ring A there is a map Proj(A)-->Proj(A^{(n)}); we identify open subspaces on which this map is an isomorphism. Applying these results when A is (a quotient of) a weighted polynomial ring produces a non-commutative resolution of (a closed subscheme of) a weighted projective space. In this article we construct a smooth Euler flow supported in a neighborhood of a helix. It may be considered a generalization of a similar solution found by the author for a circle. Let $A \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| > 1$. We show there is a $d \\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}_p^{\\\\times}$ such that $d \\\\cdot A$ contains a gap of size at least $2p/ |A| - 2 $. Let A be a noetherian local commutative ring and let M be a suitable complex of A-modules. This paper proves that M is a dualizing complex for A if and only if the trivial extension A \\\\ltimes M is a Gorenstein Differential Graded Algebra. As a corollary follows that A has a dualizing complex if and only if it is a quotient of a Gorenstein local Differential Graded Algebra. Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A means a weak structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B which is embedded with a stronger structure S. By proper subset one understands a set included in A, different from the empty set, from the unit element if any, and from A. These types of structures occur in our every day\\'s life, that\\'s why we study them in this book. Thus, as three particular cases: 1) A Smarandache semiring is a semiring A such that a proper subset B of A is a semifield (with respect to the same induced operation). 2) A Smarandache semifield is a semifield A such that a proper subset B of A is a k-semi algebra, with respect to the same induced operations and an external operator. 3) A Smarandache semivector space is a semivector space A (over a semifield B) which is a Smarandache semigroup. Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A means a weak structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B contained in A which is embedded with a stronger structure S. These types of structures occur in our everyday\\'s life, that\\'s why we study them in this book. Thus, as a particular case: A Near-ring is a non-empty set N together with two binary operations \\'+\\' and \\'.\\' such that (N, +) is a group (not necessarily abelian), (N, .) is a semigroup. For all a, b, c belonging to N we have (a + b) . c = a . c + b . c A Near-field is a non-empty set P together with two binary operations \\'+\\' and \\'.\\' such that (P, +) is a group (not-necessarily abelian), {P\\\\{0}, .) is a group. For all a, b, c belonging to P we have (a + b) . c = a . c + b . c A Smarandache Near-ring is a near-ring N which has a proper subset P contained in N, where P is a near-field (with respect to the same binary operations on N). The basic notion of the article is a pair (A,U), where A is a commutative C*-algebra and U is a partial isometry such that mapping U()U* is an endomorphism of A and U*U belongs to A. We give a description of the maximal ideal space of the smallest coefficient C*-algebra of the algebra C*(A,U) generated by the system (A,U). Let $A$ be an algebra and let $X$ be an $A$-bimodule. A $\\\\Bbb C-$linear mapping $d:A \\\\to X$ is called a generalized Jordan derivation if there exists a Jordan derivation (in the usual sense) $\\\\delta:A \\\\to X$ such that $d(a^2)=ad(a)+\\\\delta(a)a$ for all $a \\\\in A.$ The main purpose of this paper to prove the Hyers-Ulam-Rassias stability and superstability of the generalized Jordan derivations. Let A be a central division algebra over a field F with ind A = n. In computing canonical p-dimension of projective PGL_1(A)-homogeneous varieties, for p prime, we can reduce to the case of generalized Severi-Brauer varieties X_e(A) with ind A a power of p divisible by e. We prove that canonical 2-dimension (and hence canonical dimension) equals dimension for all X_e(A) with ind A = 2e a power of 2. We show that for a Banach algebra $A$ with a bounded approximate identity, the amenability of the projective tensor product of A with A, the amenability of the projective tensor product of A with A^{op}and the amenability of A are equivalent. Also if A is a closed ideal in a commutative Banach algebra B, then the weak amenability of the projective tensor product of A and B implies the weak amenability of A. It is proven that every flat connection or covariant derivative $\\\\nabla$ on a left $A$-module $M$ (with respect to the universal differential calculus) induces a right $A$-module structure on $M$ so that $\\\\nabla$ is a bimodule connection on $M$ or $M$ is a flat differentiable bimodule. Similarly a flat hom-connection on a right $A$-module $M$ induces a compatible left $A$-action. A simple proof is given for the explicit formula which allows one to recover a $C^2-$smooth vector field $A=A(x)$ in $\\\\mathbb{R}^3$, decaying at infinity, from the knowledge of its $\\\\nabla \\\\times A$ and $\\\\nabla \\\\cdot A$. The representation of $A$ as a sum of the gradient field and a divergence-free vector fields is derived from this formula. Similar results are obtained for a vector field in a bounded $C^2-$smooth domain. In this paper, we introduce some new classes of algebras related to UP-algebras and semigroups, called a left UP-semigroup, a right UP-semigroup, a fully UP-semigroup, a left-left UP-semigroup, a right-left UP-semigroup, a left-right UP-semigroup, a right-right UP-semigroup, a fully-left UP-semigroup, a fully-right UP-semigroup, a left-fully UP-semigroup, a right-fully UP-semigroup, a fully-fully UP-semigroup, and find their examples. Let $G$ be a finite group and let $\\\\pi$ be a set of primes. In this paper, we prove a criterion for the existence of a solvable $\\\\pi$-Hall subgroup of $G$, precisely, the group $G$ has a solvable $\\\\pi$-Hall subgroup if, and only if, $G$ has a $\\\\{p,q\\\\}$-Hall subgroup for any pair $p$, $q\\\\in\\\\pi$. Let A be a quasi-finite R-algebra (i.e., a direct limit of module finite algebras) with identity. Let I_i, i=0,...,m, be two-sided ideals of A, \\\\GL_n(A,I_i) the principal congruence subgroup of level I_i in GL_n(A) and E_n(A,I_i) be the relative elementary subgroup of level I_i. We prove a multiple commutator formula [E_n(A,I_0),\\\\GL_n(A,I_1),& \\\\GL_n(A, I_2),..., \\\\GL_n(A, I_m)] = [E_n(A,I_0),E_n(A,I_1),E_n(A, I_2),..., E_n(A, I_m)], which is a broad generalization of the standard commutator formulas. Let $A$ be a Banach algebra and $X$ be a Banach $A$-bimodule. A mapping $D :A\\\\longrightarrow X$ is a cubic derivation if $D$ is a cubic homogeneous mapping, that is $D$ is cubic and $D(\\\\lambda a)={\\\\lambda}^3 D(a)$ for any complex number $\\\\lambda$ and all $a\\\\in A$, and $D(ab)=D(a)\\\\cdot b^3 +a^3\\\\cdot D(b)$ for all $a,b\\\\in A$. In this paper, we prove the stability of a cubic derivation with direct method. We also employ a fixed point method to establish of the stability and the superstability for cubic derivations. Let A be a finite set of reals and let K >= 1 be a real number. Suppose that for each a in A we are given an injective map f_a : A -> R which fixes a and contracts other points towards it in the sense that |a - f_a(x)| <= |a - x|/K for all x in A, and such that f_a(x) always lies between a and x. Then the union of the f_a(A) has cardinality >= K|A|/10 - O_K(1). An immediate consequence of this is the estimate |A + K.A| >= K|A|/10 - O_K(1), which is a slightly weakened version of a result of Bukh. Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a field $k$. In this paper we define a filtration $F^{r}$ of the group $CH_{0}(A)$ and prove an isomorphism $\\\\frac{K(k;A,...,A)}{\\\\Sym}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbb{Z}[\\\\frac{1}{r!}]\\\\simeq F^{r}/F^{r+1}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbb{Z}[\\\\frac{1}{r!}]$, where $K(k;A,...,A)$ is the Somekawa K-group attached to $r$-copies of the abelian variety $A$.\\\\\\\\ In the special case when $k$ is a finite extension of $\\\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ and $A$ has split multiplicative reduction, we compute the kernel of the map $CH_{0}(A)\\\\otimes\\\\Z[\\\\frac{1}{2}]\\\\rightarrow \\\\rm{Hom}(Br(A),\\\\Q/\\\\Z)\\\\otimes\\\\Z[\\\\frac{1}{2}]$, induced by the pairing $CH_{0}(A)\\\\times Br(A)\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{Q}/\\\\Z$. Let $A$ be a set and $f:A\\\\rightarrow A$ a bijective function. Necessary and sufficient conditions on $f$ are determined which makes it possible to endow $A$ with a binary operation $*$ such that $(A,*)$ is a cyclic group and $f\\\\in \\\\mbox{Aut}(A)$. This result is extended to all abelian groups in case $|A|=p^2, \\\\ p$ a prime. Finally, in case $A$ is countably infinite, those $f$ for which it is possible to turn $A$ into a group $(A,*)$ isomorphic to ${\\\\Bbb Z}^n$ for some $n\\\\ge 1$, and with $f\\\\in \\\\mbox{Aut} (A)$, are completely characterised. For a set $A$ of nonnegative integers, let $R_2(A,n)$ and $R_3(A,n)$ denote the number of solutions to $n=a+a\\'$ with $a,a\\'\\\\in A$, $a<a\\'$ and $a\\\\leq a\\'$, respectively. In this paper, we prove that, if $A\\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{N}$ and $N$ is a positive integer such that $R_2(A,n)=R_2(\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\setminus A,n)$ for all $n\\\\geq2N-1$, then for any $\\\\theta$ with $0<\\\\theta<\\\\frac{2\\\\log2-\\\\log3}{42\\\\log 2-9\\\\log3}$, the set of integers $n$ with $R_2(A,n)=\\\\frac{n}{8}+O(n^{1-\\\\theta})$ has density one. The similar result holds for $R_3(A,n)$. These improve the results of the first author. The unified product was defined in \\\\cite{am3} related to the restricted extending structure problem for Hopf algebras: a Hopf algebra $E$ factorizes through a Hopf subalgebra $A$ and a subcoalgebra $H$ such that $1\\\\in H$ if and only if $E$ is isomorphic to a unified product $A \\\\ltimes H$. Using the concept of normality of a morphism of coalgebras in the sense of Andruskiewitsch and Devoto we prove an equivalent description for the unified product from the point of view of split morphisms of Hopf algebras. A Hopf algebra $E$ is isomorphic to a unified product $A \\\\ltimes H$ if and only if there exists a morphism of Hopf algebras $i: A \\\\rightarrow E$ which has a retraction $\\\\pi: E \\\\to A$ that is a normal left $A$-module coalgebra morphism. A necessary and sufficient condition for the canonical morphism $i : A \\\\to A\\\\ltimes H$ to be a split monomorphism of bialgebras is proved, i.e. a condition for the unified product $A\\\\ltimes H$ to be isomorphic to a Radford biproduct $L \\\\ast A$, for some bialgebra $L$ in the category $_{A}^{A}{\\\\mathcal YD}$ of Yetter-Drinfel\\'d modules. As a consequence, we present a general method to construct unified products arising from an unitary not necessarily associative bialgebra $H$ that is a right $A$-module coalgebra and a unitary coalgebra map $\\\\gamma : H \\\\to A$ satisfying four compatibility conditions. Such an example is worked out in detail for a group $G$, a pointed right $G$-set $(X, \\\\cdot, \\\\lhd)$ and a map $\\\\gamma : G \\\\to X$. Let $A$ and $B$ be C$^*$-algebras. A linear map $T:A\\\\to B$ is said to be a $^*$-homomorphism at an element $z\\\\in A$ if $a b^*=z$ in $A$ implies $T (a b^*) =T (a) T (b)^* =T(z)$, and $ c^* d=z$ in $A$ gives $T (c^* d) =T (c)^* T (d) =T(z).$ Assuming that $A$ is unital, we prove that every linear map $T: A\\\\to B$ which is a $^*$-homomorphism at the unit of $A$ is a Jordan $^*$-homomorphism. If $A$ is simple and infinite, then we establish that a linear map $T: A\\\\to B$ is a $^*$-homomorphism if and only if $T$ is a $^*$-homomorphism at the unit of $A$. For a general unital C$^*$-algebra $A$ and a linear map $T:A\\\\to B$, we prove that $T$ is a $^*$-homomorphism if, and only if, $T$ is a $^*$-homomorphism at $0$ and at $1$. Actually if $p$ is a non-zero projection in $A$, and $T$ is a $^*$-homomorphism at $p$ and at $1-p$, then we prove that $T$ is a Jordan $^*$-homomorphism. We also study bounded linear maps that are $^*$-homomorphisms at a unitary element in $A$. The monomorphism category $\\\\mathcal S_n(\\\\mathcal X)$ is introduced, where $\\\\mathcal X$ is a full subcategory of the module category $A$-mod of Artin algebra $A$. The key result is a reciprocity of the monomorphism operator $\\\\mathcal S_n$ and the left perpendicular operator $^\\\\perp$: for a cotilting $A$-module $T$, there is a canonical construction of a cotilting $T_n(A)$-module ${\\\\rm \\\\bf m}(T)$, such that $\\\\mathcal S_n(^\\\\perp T) = \\\\ ^\\\\perp {\\\\rm \\\\bf m}(T)$. As applications, $\\\\mathcal S_n(\\\\mathcal X)$ is a resolving contravariantly finite subcategory in $T_n(A)$-mod with $\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal S_n(\\\\mathcal X)} = T_n(A)$-mod if and only if $\\\\mathcal X$ is a resolving contravariantly finite subcategory in $A$-mod with $\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal X} = A$-mod. For a Gorenstein algebra $A$, the category $T_n(A)\\\\mbox{-}\\\\mathcal Gproj$ of Gorenstein-projective $T_n(A)$-modules can be explicitly determined as $\\\\mathcal S_n(^\\\\perp A)$. Also, self-injective algebras $A$ can be characterized by the property $T_n(A)\\\\mbox{-}\\\\mathcal Gproj = \\\\mathcal S_n(A)$. Using $\\\\mathcal S_n(A)= \\\\ ^\\\\perp {\\\\rm \\\\bf m}(D(A_A))$, a characterization of $\\\\mathcal S_n(A)$ of finite type is obtained. It is a simple fact that a subgroup generated by a subset $A$ of an abelian group is the direct sum of the cyclic groups $\\\\langle a\\\\rangle$, $a\\\\in A$ if and only if the set $A$ is independent. In [5] the concept of an $independent$ set in an abelian group was generalized to a $topologically$ $independent$ $set$ in a topological abelian group (these two notions coincide in discrete abelian groups). It was proved that a topological subgroup generated by a subset $A$ of an abelian topological group is the Tychonoff direct sum of the cyclic topological groups $\\\\langle a\\\\rangle$, $a\\\\in A$ if and only if the set $A$ is topologically independent and absolutely Cauchy summable. Further, it was shown, that the assumption of absolute Cauchy summability of $A$ can not be removed in general in this result. In our paper we show that it can be removed in precompact groups. In other words, we prove that if $A$ is a subset of a {\\\\em precompact} abelian group, then the topological subgroup generated by $A$ is the Tychonoff direct sum of the topological cyclic subgroups $\\\\langle a\\\\rangle$, $a\\\\in A$ if and only if $A$ is topologically independent. We show that precompactness can not be replaced by local compactness in this result. Let $T:A\\\\to X$ be a bounded linear operator, where $A$ is a C$^*$-algebra, and $X$ denotes an essential Banach $A$-bimodule. We prove that the following statements are equivalent: $(a)$ $T$ is anti-derivable at zero (i.e. $ab =0$ in $A$ implies $T(b) a + b T(a)=0$); $(b)$ There exist an anti-derivation $d:A\\\\to X^{**}$ and an element $\\\\xi \\\\in X^{**}$ satisfying $\\\\xi a = a \\\\xi,$ $\\\\xi [a,b]=0,$ $T(a b) = b T(a) + T(b) a - b \\\\xi a,$ and $T(a) = d(a) + \\\\xi a,$ for all $a,b\\\\in A$. We also prove a similar equivalence when $X$ is replaced with $A^{**}$. This provides a complete characterization of those bounded linear maps from $A$ into $X$ or into $A^{**}$ which are anti-derivable at zero. We also present a complete characterization of those continuous linear operators which are $^*$-anti-derivable at zero. Motivated by Vesterstr{\\\\o}m\\'s theorem for the unital case and by recent results for the Dixmier property, we give a number of equivalent conditions (including weak centrality) for a $C^*$-algebra to have the centre-quotient property. We show that every $C^*$-algebra $A$ has a largest weakly central ideal $J_{wc}(A)$. For an ideal $I$ of a unital $C^*$-algebra $A$, we find a necessary and sufficient condition for a central element of $A/I$ to lift to a central element of $A$. This leads to a characterisation of the set $V_A$ of elements of an arbitrary $C^*$-algebra $A$ which prevent $A$ from having the centre-quotient property. The complement $\\\\mathrm{CQ}(A):= A \\\\setminus V_A$ always contains $Z(A)+J_{wc}(A)$ (where $Z(A)$ is the centre of $A$), with equality if and only if $A/J_{wc}(A)$ is abelian. Otherwise, $\\\\mathrm{CQ}(A)$ fails spectacularly to be a $C^*$-subalgebra of $A$: it is not norm-closed and it is neither closed under addition nor closed under multiplication. Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A means a weak structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B contained in A which is embedded with a stronger structure S. These types of structures occur in our everyday life, that\\'s why we study them in this book. Thus, as a particular case: A Smarandache semigroup is a semigroup A which has a proper subset B contained in A that is a group (with respect to the same binary operation on A). Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A means a weak structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B which is embedded with a stronger structure S. By proper subset one understands a set included in A, different from the empty set, from the unit element if any, and from A. These types of structures occur in our everyday\\'s life, thats why we study them in this book. As an example: A non-empty set L is said to form a loop, if on L is defined a binary operation called product, denoted by \\'.\\' such that: for all a, b belonging to L we have a . b belonging to L (closure property); there exists an element e belonging to L such that a . e = e . a = a for all a belonging to L (e is the identity element of L); for every ordered pair (a, b) belonging to L x L there exists a unique pair (p, q) in L such that ap = b and qa = b. Whence: A Smarandache Loop (or S-Loop) is a loop L such that a proper subset M of L is a subgroup (with respect to the same induced operation). Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A means a weak structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B which is embedded with a stronger structure S. By proper subset one understands a set included in A, different from the empty set, from the unit element if any, and from A. These types of structures occur in our everyday\\'s life thats why we study them in this book. Thus, as two particular cases: A Smarandache Ring of level I (S-ring I) is a ring R that contains a proper subset that is a field with respect to the operations induced. A Smarandache Ring of level II (S-ring II) is a ring R that contains a proper subset A that verifies: A is an additive abelian group; A is a semigroup under multiplication, for a, b belonging to A, a . b = 0 if and only if a = 0 or b = 0. Electric susceptibility of a laser-dressed atomic medium is calculated for a model Lambda - like system including two lower states and a continuum structured by a presence of an autoionizing state or a continuum with a laser-induced structure. Depending on the strength of a control field it is possible to obtain a significant reduction of the light velocity in a narrow frequency window in the conditions of a small absorption. A smooth transition is shown between the case of a flat continuum and that of a discrete state serving as the upper state of a Lambda system. There are well-known monomorphisms between the Artin groups of finite type $\\\\arA_n$, $\\\\arB_n=\\\\arC_n$ and affine type $\\\\tilde \\\\arA_{n-1}$, $\\\\tilde\\\\arC_{n-1}$. The Artin group $A(\\\\arA_n)$ is isomorphic to the $(n+1)$-strand braid group $B_{n+1}$, and the other three Artin groups are isomorphic to some subgroups of $B_{n+1}$. The inclusions between these subgroups yield monomorphisms $A(\\\\arB_n)\\\\to A(\\\\arA_n)$, $A(\\\\tilde \\\\arA_{n-1})\\\\to A(\\\\arB_n)$ and $A(\\\\tilde \\\\arC_{n-1})\\\\to A(\\\\arB_n)$. There are another type of monomorphisms $A(\\\\arB_d)\\\\to A(\\\\arA_{md-1})$, $A(\\\\arB_d)\\\\to A(\\\\arB_{md})$ and $A(\\\\arB_d)\\\\to A(\\\\arA_{md})$ which are induced by isomorphisms between Artin groups of type $\\\\arB$ and centralizers of periodic braids. In this paper, we show that the monomorphisms $A(\\\\arB_d)\\\\to A(\\\\arA_{md-1})$, $A(\\\\arB_d)\\\\to A(\\\\arB_{md})$ and $A(\\\\arB_d)\\\\to A(\\\\arA_{md})$ induce injective functions on the set of conjugacy classes, and that none of the monomorphisms $A(\\\\arB_n)\\\\to A(\\\\arA_n)$, $A(\\\\tilde \\\\arA_{n-1})\\\\to A(\\\\arB_n)$ and $A(\\\\tilde \\\\arC_{n-1})\\\\to A(\\\\arB_n)$ does so. We show that for any set A in a finite Abelian group G that has at least c |A|^3 solutions to a_1 + a_2 = a_3 + a_4, where a_i belong A there exist sets A\\' in A and L in G, |L| \\\\ll c^{-1} log |A| such that A\\' is contained in Span of L and A\\' has approximately c |A|^3 solutions to a\\'_1 + a\\'_2 = a\\'_3 + a\\'_4, where a\\'_i belong A\\'. We also study so-called symmetric sets or, in other words, sets of large values of convolution. A spanning subgraph of a graph G is called a [0,2]-factor of G, if for . is a union of some disjoint cycles, paths and isolate vertices, that span the graph G. It is easy to get a [0,2]-factor of G and there would be many of [0,2]-factors for a G.A characteristic number for a [0,2]-factor, which reflect the number of the paths and isolate vertices in it,is defineted. The [0,2]-factor of G is called maximum if its characteristic number is minimum, and is called characteristic number of G.It to be proved that characteristic number of graph is a graph invariant and a polynomial time algorithm for computing a maximum [0,2]-factor of a graph G has been given in this paper. A [0,2]-factor is Called a 2-factor, if its characteristic number is zero. That is, a 2-factor is a set of some disjoint cycles, that span G.We propose a A polynomial time algorism for computing 2-factor from a [0,2]-factor,which can be got easily. A HAMILTON Cycle is a 2-factor, therefore a necessary condition of a HAMILTON Graph is that, the graph have a 2-factor or the characteristic number of the graph is zero. The algorism, given in this paper, make it possible to examine the condition in polynomial time. We present two results on expansion of Cayley graphs. The first result settles a conjecture made by DeVos and Mohar. Specifically, we prove that for any positive constant $c$ there exists a finite connected subset $A$ of the Cayley graph of $\\\\mathbb{Z}^2$ such that $\\\\frac{|\\\\partial A|}{|A|}< \\\\frac{c}{depth(A)}$. This yields that there can be no universal bound for $\\\\frac{|\\\\partial A|depth(A)}{|A|}$ for subsets of either infinite or finite vertex transitive graphs. Let $X=(V,E)$ be the Cayley graph of a finitely generated infinite group and $A\\\\subset V$ finite such that $A\\\\cup\\\\partial A$ is connected. Our second result is that if $|A|> 16|\\\\partial A|^2$ then $X$ has a ring-like structure. A ring A is called presimplifiable if whenever a; b belongs to A and a = ab, then either a = 0 or b is a unit in A. Let A be a commutative ring and G be an abelian torsion group. For the group ring A[G], we prove that A[G] is presimplifiable if and only if A is presimplifiable and G is a p-group with p belongs to the Jacobson radical of A, and it is shown that A[G] is domainlike (i.e all zero divisors are nilpotents) if and only if A is domainlike and G is a p-group and p is a nilpotent in A. Furthermore, whenever the group ring A[G] is presimplifiable we prove that A[H] is presimplifiable for any subgroup H of G. Also, for a torsion free group G we prove that A[G] is domainlike if and only if A[G] is integral domain. In this paper mechanisms of reversion - momentum transition are considered. Two basic nonlinear mechanisms are highlighted: a slow and fast bifurcation. A slow bifurcation leads to the equilibrium evolution, preceded by stability loss delay of a control parameter. A single order parameter is introduced by Markovian chain diffusion, which plays a role of a precursor. A fast bifurcation is formed by a singular fusion of unstable and stable equilibrium states. The effect of a precatastrophic range compression is observed before the discrete change of a system. A diffusion time scaling is presented as a precursor of the fast bifurcation. The efficiency of both precursors in a currency market was illustrated by simulation of a prototype of a trading system. It is known that any covering space of a topological group has the natural structure of a topological group. This article discusses a noncommutative generalization of this fact. A noncommutative generalization of the topological group is a quantum group. Also there is a noncommutative generalization of a covering. The combination of these algebraic constructions yields a motive to research the generalization of coverings of topological groups. In contrary to a topological group a covering space of a quantum group does not have the natural structure of the quantum group. However a covering space of a quantum group satisfies to a condition which is weaker than the condition of a covering space of a topological group. A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is said to be a TNI-subgroup if $N_{G}(H)\\\\cap H^g=1$ for any $g\\\\in G\\\\,\\\\backslash \\\\,N_{G}(H).$ Let $A$ be an abelian group acting coprimely on the finite group $G$ by automorphisms in such a way that $C_G(A)=\\\\{g\\\\in G : g^a=g $\\\\, for all $a\\\\in A\\\\}$ is a solvable TNI-subgroup of $G$. We prove that $G$ is a solvable group with Fitting length $h(G)$ is at most $h(C_G(A))+\\\\ell(A)$. In particular $h(G)\\\\leq \\\\ell(A)+3$ whenever $C_G(A)$ is nonnormal. Here, $h(G)$ is the Fitting length of $G$ and $\\\\ell(A)$ is the number of primes dividing $A$ counted with multiplicities. We give a construction of a non-degenerate polynomial $F\\\\in \\\\mathbb R[x,y,z]$ and a set $A$ of cardinality $n$ such that $\\\\left|Z(F)\\\\cap (A \\\\times A \\\\times A) \\\\right| \\\\gg n^{\\\\frac{3}{2}}$, thus providing a new lower bound construction for the Elekes--Szab\\\\\\'o problem. We also give a related construction for the Elekes--R\\\\\\'onyai problem restricted to a subgraph. This consists of a polynomial $f\\\\in \\\\mathbb R[x,y]$ that is not additive or multiplicative, a set $A$ of size $n$, and a subset $P\\\\subset A\\\\times A$ of size $|P|\\\\gg n^{3/2}$ on which $f$ takes only $n$ distinct values. For a set $A$ of nonnegative integers, let $R_2(A,n)$ denote the number of solutions to $n=a+a\\'$ with $a,a\\'\\\\in A$, $a<a\\'$. Let $A_0$ be the Thue-Morse sequence and $B_0=\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\setminus A_0$. Let $A\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{N}$ and $N$ be a positive integer such that $R_2(A,n)=R_2(\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\setminus A,n)$ for all $n\\\\geq 2N-1$. Previously, the first author proved that if $|A\\\\cap A_0|=+\\\\infty$ and $|A\\\\cap B_0|=+\\\\infty$, then $R_2(A,n)\\\\geq \\\\frac{n+3}{56N-52}-1$ for all $n\\\\geq 1$. In this paper, we prove that the above lower bound is nearly best possible. We also get some other results. We examine the electric-magnetic duality for a U(1) gauge theory on a general 4-manifold. The partition function for such a theory transforms as a modular form of specific weight. However, in the canonical approach, we show that S-duality, like T-duality, is generated by a canonical transformation leading to a modular invariant partition function. Let A and B be two finite subsets of a field F. In this paper we provide a nontrivial lower bound for |{a+b: a in A, b in B, and P(a,b) not=0}| where $P(x,y)\\\\in F[x,y]$. Let $G$ be a supersolvable group and $A$ be a conjugacy class of $G$. Observe that for some integer $\\\\eta(AA^{-1})>0$, $AA^{-1}=\\\\{a b^{-1}\\\\mid a,b\\\\in A\\\\}$ is the union of $\\\\eta(AA^{-1})$ distinct conjugacy classes of $G$. Set ${\\\\bf C}_G(A)=\\\\{g\\\\in G\\\\mid a^g=a\\\\text{for all} a\\\\in A\\\\}$. Then the derived length of $G/{\\\\bf C}_G(A)$ is less or equal than $2\\\\eta(A A^{-1})-1$. First, we review the notion of a Poisson structure on a noncommutative algebra due to Block-Getzler and Xu and introduce a notion of a Hamiltonian vector field on a noncommutative Poisson algebra. Then we describe a Poisson structure on a noncommutative algebra associated with a transversely symplectic foliation and construct a class of Hamiltonian vector fields associated with this Poisson structure. We calculate the asymptotic average rate at which a generic geodesic on a finite area hyperbolic 2-orbifold returns to a subsurface with geodesic boundary. As a consequence we get the average time a generic geodesic spends in such a subsurface. Related results are obtained for excursions into a collar neighborhood of a simple closed geodesic and the associated distribution of excursion depths. We prove that if a solvable group A acts coprimely on a solvable group G, then A has a \"large\" orbit in its corresponding action on the set of ordinary complex irreducible characters of G. This extends (at the cost of a weaker bound) a 2005 result of A. Moreto who obtained such a bound in case that A is a p-group. Assume that A is a purely infinite simple C*-algebra whose K_0 is a torsion group, namely, contains no free element. Then a positive element a in A can be written as a finite sum of projections in A if and only if either a is a projection or the norm ||a||>1. Let R be a ring and G a group. An R-module A is said to be artinian-by-(finite rank) if TorR(A) is artinian and A/TorR(A) has finite R-rank. The authors study ZG-modules A such that A/CA(H) is artinian-by-(finite rank) (as a Z-module) for every proper subgroup H. Let R be a ring and G a group. An R-module A is said to be minimax if A includes an noetherian submodule B such that A=B is artinian. The authors study a ZG-module A such that A/C_A(H) is minimax (as a Z-module) for every proper not finitely generated subgroup H. For a derivation d of a commutative Noetherian complex algebra A, a homeomorphism is established between the prime spectrum of the Ore extension A[z;d] and the Poisson prime spectrum of the polynomial algebra A[z] endowed with the Poisson bracket such that {A,A}=0 and {z,a}=d(a) for all a in A. Several illustrative examples are discussed including some where A is known to be d-simple. We show that every abstract Krivine structure in the sense of Streicher can be obtained, up to equivalence of the resulting tripos, from a filtered opca (A,A\\') and a subobject of 1 in the relative realizability topos RT(A\\',A); the topos is always a Booleanization of a closed subtopos of RT(A\\',A). We exhibit a range of non-localic Boolean subtoposes of the Kleene-Vesley topos. In this paper, we discuss when a class function on a finite group is a bent function. We have found a necessary condition for a class function on a finite abelian group to be bent. Also, we have found a necessary and sufficient condition for a class function on a finite cyclic group to be bent. Coste and Roy defined a structural sheaf on the real Zariski spectrum of a semi-real ring $A$ and asked whether the ring of global sections is $\\\\sum_1^{-1} A$ when $\\\\Sigma_1$ is the multiplicative subset $\\\\{ 1+\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i^{2}\\\\,|a_i\\\\in A, n\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}\\\\cup\\\\{0\\\\}\\\\}$ of $A$. We give a positive answer to this question in the case of $A$ is a real ring. A Lie superalgebrea of Riemannian type leads to a representation of a quadratic Lie algebra into a Weyl algebra. A necessary and sufficient condition that such a representation leads to a Lie superalgebra of Riemannian type is that the Casimir maps to a constant. Recently N.A\\'Campo suggested a construction of a link from a generic immersion of a curve into a 2-disk. It is tightly related to the singularity theory. In this paper, we give a simple procedure to draw a diagram of the link from a picture of the curve. For a given $\\\\omega$-operad $A$ on globular sets we introduce a sequence of symmetric operads on $Set$ called slices of $A$ and show how the connected limit preserving properties of slices are related to the property of the category of $n$-computads of $A$ being a presheaf topos. A simple proof of (2n)-weak amenability of the triangular Banach algebra T= [(A A) (0 A)] is given where A is a unital C*-algebra. We deform a map into a Riemannian manifold that is horizontal with respect to a submersion onto a non-positively curved manifold and satisfies a Chow condition into a harmonic one through a horizontal homotopy. In this paper, we present a correct proof of an $L_p$-inequality concerning the polar derivative of a polynomial with restricted zeros. We also extend Zygmund\\'s inequality to the polar derivative of a polynomial. A unitary operator $V$ and a rank $2$ operator $R$ acting on a Hilbert space $\\\\H$ are constructed such that $V+R$ is hypercyclic. This answers affirmatively a question of Salas whether a finite rank perturbation of a hyponormal operator can be supercyclic. For an extension A/B of neither necessarily associative nor necessarily unital rings, we investigate the connection between simplicity of A with a property that we call A-simplicity of B. By this we mean that there is no non-trivial ideal I of B being A-invariant, that is satisfying AI \\\\subseteq IA. We show that A-simplicity of B is a necessary condition for simplicity of A for a large class of ring extensions when B is a direct summand of A. To obtain sufficient conditions for simplicity of A, we introduce the concept of a degree map for A/B. By this we mean a map d from A to the set of non-negative integers satisfying the following two conditions (d1) if a \\\\in A, then d(a)=0 if and only if a=0; (d2) there is a subset X of B generating B as a ring such that for each non-zero ideal I of A and each non-zero a \\\\in I there is a non-zero a\\' \\\\in I with d(a\\') \\\\leq d(a) and d(a\\'b - ba\\') < d(a) for all b \\\\in X. We show that if the centralizer C of B in A is an A-simple ring, every intersection of C with an ideal of A is A-invariant, ACA=A and there is a degree map for A/B, then A is simple. We apply these results to various types of graded and filtered rings, such as skew group rings, Ore extensions and Cayley-Dickson doublings. Order estimates for Kolmogorov, Gelfand and linear widths of a weighted Sobolev class on a domain with a peak in a weighted Lebesgue space are obtained for some special weights. Under a certain condition A we give a construction to calculate the intersection cohomology of a rank one local system on the complement to a hyperplane-like divisor We prove two results about the derived functor of $a$-adic completion: (1) Let $K$ be a commutative noetherian ring, let $A$ be a flat noetherian $K$-algebra which is $a$-adically complete with respect to some ideal $a\\\\subseteq A$, such that $A/a$ is essentially of finite type over $K$, and let $M,N$ be finitely generated $A$-modules. Then adic reduction to the diagonal holds: $A\\\\otimes^{L}_{ A\\\\hat{\\\\otimes}_{K} A } ( M\\\\hat{\\\\otimes}^{L}_{K} N ) \\\\cong M \\\\otimes^{L}_A N$. A similar result is given in the case where $M,N$ are not necessarily finitely generated. (2) Let $A$ be a commutative ring, let $a\\\\subseteq A$ be a weakly proregular ideal, let $M$ be an $A$-module, and assume that the $a$-adic completion of $A$ is noetherian (if $A$ is noetherian, all these conditions are always satisfied). Then $\\\\mbox{Ext}^i_A(A/a,M)$ is finitely generated for all $i\\\\ge 0$ if and only if the derived $a$-adic completion $\\\\L\\\\hat{\\\\Lambda}_{a}(M)$ has finitely generated cohomologies over $\\\\hat{A}$. The first result is a far reaching generalization of a result of Serre, who proved this in case $K$ is a field or a discrete valuation ring and $A = K[[x_1,\\\\dots,x_n]]$. We show if $A$ is a finite CW-complex such that algebraic theories detect mapping spaces out of $A$, then $A$ has the homology type of a wedge of spheres of the same dimension. Furthermore, if $A$ is simply connected then $A$ has the homotopy type of a wedge of spheres. On every set A there is a rigid binary relation i.e. such a relation R \\\\subseteq A \\\\times A that there is no homomorphism (A,R) \\\\rightarrow (A,R) except the identity (Vop{\\\\v{e}}nka et al. [1965]). We prove that for each infinite cardinal number \\\\kappa if card A \\\\leq 2^\\\\kappa, then there exists a relation R \\\\subseteq A \\\\times A with the following property: \\\\forall (x \\\\in A) \\\\exists ({x} \\\\subseteq A(x) \\\\subseteq A, card A(x) \\\\leq \\\\kappa) \\\\forall (f: A(x) \\\\rightarrow A, f \\\\neq id_A(x)) f is not a homomorphism of R. The above property implies that R is rigid. If a relation R \\\\subseteq A \\\\times A has the above property, then card A \\\\leq 2^\\\\kappa. In this paper, we discuss when Aut($\\\\cal A$) and Homeo(Prim($\\\\cal A$)) are homeomorphic, where $\\\\cal A$ is a $C^*$-algebra. A heuristic derivation of quantum mechanics using information theory requires a foundational physical principle: the existence of a universal action reservoir, analogous to the energy reservoir of a canonical ensemble. In a recent paper, Daisuke Tambara defined two-sided actions on an endomodule (= endodistributor) of a monoidal V-category A. When A is autonomous (= rigid = compact), he showed that the V-category (that we call Tamb(A)) of so-equipped endomodules (that we call Tambara modules) is equivalent to the monoidal centre Z[A,V] of the convolution monoidal V-category [A,V]. Our paper extends these ideas somewhat. For general A, we construct a promonoidal V-category DA (which we suggest should be called the double of A) with an equivalence [DA,V] \\\\simeq Tamb(A). When A is closed, we define strong (respectively, left strong) Tambara modules and show that these constitute a V-category Tamb_s(A) (respectively, Tamb_{ls}(A)) which is equivalent to the centre (respectively, lax centre) of [A,V]. We construct localizations D_s A and D_{ls} A of DA such that there are equivalences Tamb_s(A) \\\\simeq [D_s A,V] and Tamb_{ls}(A) \\\\simeq [D_{ls} A,V]. When A is autonomous, every Tambara module is strong; this implies an equivalence Z[A,V] \\\\simeq [DA,V]. We prove that the shifted Hochschild chain complex $C\\\\_*(A,A)[m]$ of a symmetric open Frobenius algebra $A$ of degree $m$ has a natural homotopy coBV-algebra structure. As a consequence $HH\\\\_*(A,A)[m]$ and $HH^*(A,A^\\\\vee)[-m]$ are respectively coBV and BV algebras. The underlying coalgebra and algebra structure may not be resp. counital and unital. We also introduce a natural homotopy BV-algebra structure on $C\\\\_*(A,A)[m]$ hence a BV-structure on $HH\\\\_*(A,A)[m]$. Moreover we prove that the product and coproduct on $HH\\\\_*(A,A)[m]$ satisfy the Frobenius compatibility condition i.e. $HH\\\\_*(A,A)[m]$ is an open Frobenius algebras. If $A$ is commutative, we also introduce a natural BV structure on the shifted relative Hochschild homology $\\\\widetilde{HH}\\\\_*(A)[m-1]$. We conjecture that the product of this BV structure is identical to the Goresky-Hingston\\\\cite{GH} product on the cohomology of free loop spaces when $A$ is a commutative cochain algebra model for $M$. In this paper we present a topological way of building a compactification of a symmetric space from a compactification of a Weyl Chamber. This article defines a complement of a function and conditions for existence of such a complement function and presents few algorithms to construct a complement. We derive a matrix model, under unitary similarity, of an $n$-by-$n$ matrix $A$ such that $A, A^2, \\\\ldots, A^k$ ($k\\\\ge 1$) are all partial isometries, which generalizes the known fact that if $A$ is a partial isometry, then it is unitarily similar to a matrix of the form ${\\\\scriptsize\\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cc} 0 & B 0 & C\\\\end{array}\\\\right]}$ with $B^*B+C^*C=I$. Using this model, we show that if $A$ has ascent $k$ and $A, A^2, \\\\ldots, A^{k-1}$ are partial isometries, then the numerical range $W(A)$ of $A$ is a circular disc centered at the origin if and only if $A$ is unitarily similar to a direct sum of Jordan blocks whose largest size is $k$. As an application, this yields that, for any $S_n$-matrix $A$, $W(A)$ (resp., $W(A\\\\otimes A)$) is a circular disc centered at the origin if and only if $A$ is unitarily similar to the Jordan block $J_n$. Finally, examples are given to show that the conditions that $W(A)$ and $W(A\\\\otimes A)$ are circular discs at 0 are independent of each other for a general matrix $A$. We define the discrete norm of a complex $m\\\\times n$ matrix $A$ by $$ \\\\|A\\\\|_\\\\Delta := \\\\max_{0\\\\ne\\\\xi\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^n} \\\\frac{\\\\|A\\\\xi\\\\|}{\\\\|\\\\xi\\\\|}, $$ and show that $$ \\\\frac c{\\\\sqrt{\\\\log h(A)+1}}\\\\,\\\\|A\\\\| \\\\le \\\\|A\\\\|_\\\\Delta \\\\le \\\\|A\\\\|, $$ where $c>0$ is an explicitly indicated absolute constant, $h(A)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\|A\\\\|_1\\\\|A\\\\|_\\\\infty}/\\\\|A\\\\|$, and $\\\\|A\\\\|_1,\\\\|A\\\\|_\\\\infty$, and $\\\\|A\\\\|=\\\\|A\\\\|_2$ are the induced operator norms of $A$. Similarly, for the \\\\emph{discrete Rayleigh norm} $$ \\\\|A\\\\|_P := \\\\max_{\\\\substack{0\\\\ne\\\\xi\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^m \\\\\\\\ 0\\\\ne\\\\eta\\\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^n}} \\\\frac{|\\\\xi^tA\\\\eta|}{\\\\|\\\\xi\\\\|\\\\|\\\\eta\\\\|} $$ we prove the estimate $$ \\\\frac c{\\\\log h(A)+1}\\\\,\\\\|A\\\\| \\\\le \\\\|A\\\\|_P \\\\le \\\\|A\\\\|. $$ These estimates are shown to be essentially best possible. As a consequence, we obtain another proof of the (slightly sharpened and generalized version of the) converse to the expander mixing lemma by Bollobas-Nikiforov and Bilu-Linial. In this paper, using Pesin theory and Liao theory, we give a positive solution to a conjecture of A. Katok. Let $a$ and $b$ be elements in the closed ball of a unital C$^*$-algebra $A$ (if $A$ is not unital we consider its natural unitization). We shall say that $a$ and $b$ are domain (respectively, range) absolutely compatible ($a\\\\triangle_d b$, respectively, $a\\\\triangle_r b$, in short) if $\\\\Big| |a| -|b| \\\\Big| + \\\\Big| 1-|a|-|b| \\\\Big| =1$ (resp., $\\\\Big| |a^*| -|b^*| \\\\Big| + \\\\Big| 1-|a^*|-|b^*| \\\\Big| =1$), where $|a|^2= a^* a$. We shall say that $a$ and $b$ are absolutely compatible ($a\\\\triangle b$ in short) if they are both range and domain absolutely compatible. In general, $a\\\\triangle_d b$ (respectively, $a\\\\triangle_r b$ and $a\\\\triangle b$) is strictly weaker than $ab^*=0 $ (respectively, $a^* b =0$ and $a\\\\perp b$). Let $T: A\\\\to B$ be a contractive linear mapping between C$^*$-algebras. We prove that if $T$ preserves domain absolutely compatible elements (i.e., $a\\\\triangle_d b\\\\Rightarrow T(a)\\\\triangle_d T(b)$) then $T$ is a triple homomorphism. A similar statement is proved when $T$ preserves range absolutely compatible elements. It is finally shown that $T$ is a triple homomorphism if, and only if, $T$ preserves absolutely compatible elements. Let $A$ be a ring and $\\\\sigma: A \\\\to A$ a ring endomorphism. A generalized skew (or $\\\\sigma$-)derivation of $A$ is an additive map $d: A \\\\to A$ for which there exists a map $\\\\delta:A \\\\to A$ such that $d(xy)=\\\\delta(x)y+\\\\sigma(x)d(y)$ for all $x,y \\\\in A$. If $A$ is a prime $C^*$-algebra and $\\\\sigma$ is surjective, we determine the structure of generalized $\\\\sigma$-derivations of $A$ that belong to the cb-norm closure of elementary operators $\\\\mathcal{E}\\\\ell(A)$ on $A$; all such maps are of the form $d(x)=bx+axc$ for suitable elements $a,b,c$ of the multiplier algebra $M(A)$. As a consequence, if an epimorphism $\\\\sigma: A \\\\to A$ lies in the cb-norm closure of $\\\\mathcal{E}\\\\ell(A)$, then $\\\\sigma$ must be an inner automorphism. We also show that these results cannot be extended even to relatively well-behaved non-prime $C^*$-algebras like $C(X,\\\\mathbb{M}_2 )$. Let $(A, \\\\mathfrak m)$ be a normal two-dimensional local ring and $I$ an $\\\\mathfrak m$-primary integrally closed ideal with a minimal reduction $Q$. Then we calculate the numbers: $\\\\mathrm{nr}(I) = \\\\min\\\\{n \\\\;|\\\\; \\\\overline{I^{n+1}} = Q\\\\overline{I^n}\\\\}, \\\\quad \\\\bar{r}(I) = \\\\min\\\\{n \\\\;|\\\\; \\\\overline{I^{N+1}} = Q\\\\overline{I^N}, \\\\forall N\\\\ge n\\\\}$, $\\\\mathrm{nr}(A)$, and $\\\\bar{r}(A)$, where $\\\\mathrm{nr}(A)$ (resp. $\\\\bar{r}(A)$) is the maximum of $\\\\mathrm{nr}(I)$ (resp. $\\\\bar{r}(I)$) for all $\\\\mathfrak m$-primary integrally closed ideals $I\\\\subset A$. Then we have that $\\\\bar{r}(A) \\\\le p_g(A) + 1$, where $p_g(A)$ is the geometric genus of $A$. In this paper, we give an upper bound of $\\\\bar{r}(A)$ when $A$ is a cone-like singularity (which has a minimal resolution whose exceptional set is a single smooth curve) and show, in particular, if $A$ is a hypersurface singularity defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$, then $\\\\bar{r}(A)= \\\\mathrm{nr}(\\\\mathfrak m) = d-1$. Also we give an example of $A$ and $I$ so that $\\\\mathrm{nr}(I) = 1$ but $\\\\bar{r}(I)= \\\\bar{r}(A) = p_g(A) +1=g+1$ for every integer $g \\\\ge 2$. We study the multiplicative lattices L which satisfy the condition a = (a : (a : b))(a : b) for all a,b in L. Let $\\\\Mn$ be the ring of all $n \\\\times n$ matrices over a unital ring $\\\\mathcal{R}$, let $\\\\mathcal{M}$ be a 2-torsion free unital $\\\\Mn$-bimodule and let $D:\\\\Mn\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{M}$ be an additive map. We prove that if $D(\\\\A)\\\\B+ \\\\A D(\\\\B)+D(\\\\B)\\\\A+ \\\\B D(\\\\A)=0$ whenever $\\\\A,\\\\B\\\\in \\\\Mn$ are such that $\\\\A\\\\B=\\\\B\\\\A=0$, then $D(\\\\A)=\\\\delta(\\\\A)+\\\\A D(\\\\textbf{1})$, where $\\\\delta:\\\\Mn\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{M}$ is a derivation and $D(\\\\textbf{1})$ lies in the centre of $\\\\mathcal{M}$. It is also shown that $D$ is a generalized derivation if and only if $D(\\\\A)\\\\B+ \\\\A D(\\\\B)+D(\\\\B)\\\\A+ \\\\B D(\\\\A)-\\\\A D(\\\\textbf{1})\\\\B-\\\\B D(\\\\textbf{1})\\\\A=0$ whenever $\\\\A\\\\B=\\\\B\\\\A=0$. We apply this results to provide that any (generalized) Jordan derivation from $\\\\Mn$ into a 2-torsion free $\\\\Mn$-bimodule (not necessarily unital) is a (generalized) derivation. Also, we show that if $\\\\varphi:\\\\Mn\\\\rightarrow \\\\Mn$ is an additive map satisfying $\\\\varphi(\\\\A \\\\B+\\\\B \\\\A)=\\\\A\\\\varphi(\\\\B)+\\\\varphi(\\\\B)\\\\A \\\\quad (\\\\A,\\\\B \\\\in \\\\Mn)$, then $\\\\varphi(\\\\A)=\\\\A\\\\varphi(\\\\textbf{1})$ for all $\\\\A\\\\in \\\\Mn$, where $\\\\varphi(\\\\textbf{1})$ lies in the centre of $\\\\Mn$. By applying this result we obtain that every Jordan derivation of the trivial extension of $\\\\Mn$ by $\\\\Mn$ is a derivation. Consider the space $M_n^{nor}$ of square normal matrices $X=(x_{ij})$ over $\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\cup\\\\{-\\\\infty\\\\}$, i.e., $-\\\\infty\\\\le x_{ij}\\\\le0$ and $x_{ii}=0$. Endow $M_n^{nor}$ with the tropical sum $\\\\oplus$ and multiplication $\\\\odot$. Fix a real matrix $A\\\\in M_n^{nor}$ and consider the set $\\\\Omega(A)$ of matrices in $M_n^{nor}$ which commute with $A$. We prove that $\\\\Omega(A)$ is a finite union of alcoved polytopes; in particular, $\\\\Omega(A)$ is a finite union of convex sets. The set $\\\\Omega^A(A)$ of $X$ such that $A\\\\odot X=X\\\\odot A=A$ is also a finite union of alcoved polytopes. The same is true for the set $\\\\Omega\\'(A)$ of $X$ such that $A\\\\odot X=X\\\\odot A=X$. A topology is given to $M_n^{nor}$. Then, the set $\\\\Omega^{A}(A)$ is a neighborhood of the identity matrix $I$. If $A$ is strictly normal, then $\\\\Omega\\'(A)$ is a neighborhood of the zero matrix. In one case, $\\\\Omega(A)$ is a neighborhood of $A$. We give an upper bound for the dimension of $\\\\Omega\\'(A)$. We explore the relationship between the polyhedral complexes $span A$, $span X$ and $span (AX)$, when $A$ and $X$ commute. Two matrices, denoted $\\\\underline{A}$ and $\\\\bar{A}$, arise from $A$, in connection with $\\\\Omega(A)$. The geometric meaning of them is given in detail, for one example. We produce examples of matrices which commute, in any dimension. On the basis of the relativistic mass-energy concept we found that a proper mass of a test particle in a gravitational field depends on a potential energy, hence, a freely falling particle has a varying proper mass. Consequently, a multitude of freely falling reference frames cannot be regarded as the multitude of equivalent inertial reference frames. There is a class of experiments, which allow distinguishing between them. If so, a demonstration of a violation of the Equivalence Principle is possible. It is shown that a variant of the classical Pound-Rebka-Snider experiment on a photon frequency shift in a gravitational field if conducted in a freely falling laboratory would be such a test. We study the Dirac and the klein-Gordon oscillators in a noncommutative space. It is shown that the Klein-Gordon oscillator in a noncommutative space has a similar behaviour to the dynamics of a particle in a commutative space and in a constant magnetic field. The Dirac oscillator in a noncommutative space has a similar equation to the equation of motion for a relativistic fermion in a commutative space and in a magnetic field, however a new exotic term appears, which implies that a charged fermion in a noncommutative space has an electric dipole moment. Let $A$ be a Banach algebra. The flip on $A \\\\otimes A^\\\\op$ is defined through $A \\\\otimes A^\\\\op \\\\ni a \\\\tensor b \\\\mapsto b \\\\tensor a$. If $A$ is ultraprime, $\\\\El(A)$, the algebra of all elementary operators on $A$, can be algebraically identified with $A \\\\otimes A^\\\\op$, so that the flip is well defined on $\\\\El(\\\\A)$. We show that the flip on $\\\\El(A)$ is discontinuous if $A = K(E)$ for a reflexive Banach space $E$ with the approximation property. We prove the following theorem: for all positive integers $b$ there exists a positive integer $k$, such that for every finite set $A$ of integers with cardinality $|A| > 1$, we have either $$ |A + ... + A| \\\\geq |A|^b$$ or $$ |A \\\\cdot ... \\\\cdot A| \\\\geq |A|^b$$ where $A + ... + A$ and $A \\\\cdot ... \\\\cdot A$ are the collections of $k$-fold sums and products of elements of $A$ respectively. This is progress towards a conjecture of Erd\\\\\"os and Szemer\\\\\\'edi on sum and product sets. The detailed study of a quantum free particle on a pointed plane is performed. It is shown that there is no problem with a mysterious ``quantum anticentrifugal force\" acting on a free particle on a plane discussed in a very recent paper: M. A. Cirone et al, Phys. Rev. A 65, 022101 (2002), but we deal with a purely topological efect related to distinguishing a point on a plane. The new results are introduced concerning self-adjoint extensions of operators describing the free particle on a pointed plane as well as the role played by discrete symmetries in the analysis of such extensions. Let M be a II_1 factor, A a masa in M and E the unique conditional expectation on A. Under some technical assumptions on the inclusion of A in M, which hold true for any semiregular masa of a separable factor, we show that for every discrete a in the positive part of the unit ball of A it is possible to find a projection p in M such that E(p)=a$. We also show an example of a diffuse operator x in A such that there exists a projection q in M with E(q)=x. These results show a new family of instances of a conjecture by Kadison, the so-called \"Carpenter\\'s Theorem\". Suppose that G is a discrete abelian group and A is a finite symmetric subset of G. We show two main results. i) Either there is a set H of O(log^c|A|) subgroups of G with |A \\\\triangle \\\\bigcup H| = o(|A|), or there is a character X on G such that -wh{1_A}(X) >> log^c|A|. ii) If G is finite and |A|>> |G| then either there is a subgroup H of G such that |A \\\\triangle H| = o(|A|), or there is a character X on G such that -wh{1_A}(X)>> |A|^c. Let $\\\\mathcal A$ be a von Neumann algebra and $\\\\mathcal M$ be a Banach $\\\\mathcal A-$module. It is shown that for every homomorphisms $\\\\sigma, \\\\tau$ on $\\\\mathcal A$, every bounded linear map $f:\\\\mathcal A\\\\to \\\\mathcal M$ with property that $f(p^2)=\\\\sigma(p)f(p)+f(p)\\\\tau(p)$ for every projection $p$ in $\\\\mathcal A$ is a $(\\\\sigma,\\\\tau)-$derivation. Also, it is shown that a bounded linear map $f:\\\\mathcal A \\\\to \\\\mathcal M $ which satisfies $f(ab)= \\\\sigma(a)f(b)+f(a)\\\\tau(b)$ for all $a,b\\\\in \\\\mathcal A$ with $ab=S$, is a $(\\\\sigma,\\\\tau)-$ derivation if $\\\\tau(S)$ is left invertible for fixed $S$. In this work a possibility of a decomposition of a bounded operator which acts in a Hilbert space $H$ as a product of a J-unitary and a J-self-adjoint operators is studied, $J$ is a conjugation (an antilinear involution). Decompositions of J-unitary and unitary operators which are analogous to decompositions in the finite-dimensional case are obtained. A possibility of a matrix representation for J-symmetric, J-skew-symmetric operators is studied. Also, some simple properties of J-symmetric, J-antisymmetric, J-isometric operators are obtained, a structure of a null set for a J-form is studied. We establish several sum-product estimates over finite fields that involve polynomials and rational functions. First, |f(A)+f(A)|+|AA| is substantially larger than |A| for an arbitrary polynomial f over F_p. Second, a characterization is given for the rational functions f and g for which |f(A)+f(A)|+|g(A,A)| can be as small as |A|, for large |A|. Third, we show that under mild conditions on f, |f(A,A)| is substantially larger than |A|, provided |A| is large. We also present a conjecture on what the general sum-product result should be. A commutative local ring is generally defined to be a complete intersection if its completion is isomorphic to the quotient of a regular local ring by an ideal generated by a regular sequence. It has not previously been determined whether or not such a ring is necessarily itself the quotient of a regular ring by an ideal generated by a regular sequence. In this article, it is shown that if a complete intersection is a one dimensional integral domain, then it is such a quotient. However, an example is produced of a three dimensional complete intersection domain which is not a homomorphic image of a regular local ring, and so the property does not hold in general. This paper considers various formulations of the sum-product problem. It is shown that, for a finite set $A\\\\subset{\\\\mathbb{R}}$, $$|A(A+A)|\\\\gg{|A|^{\\\\frac{3}{2}+\\\\frac{1}{178}}},$$ giving a partial answer to a conjecture of Balog. In a similar spirit, it is established that $$|A(A+A+A+A)|\\\\gg{\\\\frac{|A|^2}{\\\\log{|A|}}},$$ a bound which is optimal up to constant and logarithmic factors. We also prove several new results concerning sum-product estimates and expanders, for example, showing that $$|A(A+a)|\\\\gg{|A|^{3/2}}$$ holds for a typical element of $A$. We introduce the notion of weak-2-local derivation (respectively, $^*$-derivation) on a C$^*$-algebra $A$ as a (non-necessarily linear) map $\\\\Delta : A\\\\to A$ satisfying that for every $a,b\\\\in A$ and $\\\\phi\\\\in A^*$ there exists a derivation (respectively, a $^*$-derivation) $D_{a,b,\\\\phi}: A\\\\to A$, depending on $a$, $b$ and $\\\\phi$, such that $\\\\phi \\\\Delta (a) = \\\\phi D_{a,b,\\\\phi} (a)$ and $\\\\phi \\\\Delta (b) = \\\\phi D_{a,b,\\\\phi} (b)$. We prove that every weak-2-local $^*$-derivation on $M_n$ is a linear derivation. We also show that the same conclusion remains true for weak-2-local $^*$-derivations on finite dimensional C$^*$-algebras. This article deals with a continuous closed 1-form defined on a CW-complex. In particular, we show Lusternik-Schnirelmann type theory on continuous closed 1-forms which is related to gradient-like flows. M.Farber defined a continuous closed 1-form and a category with a respect to a cohomology class and constructed a Lusternik-Schnirelman Theory for smooth closed 1-forms. We denote about a definition of a zero-point of continuous closed 1-form and generalize this theory to continuous closed 1-forms. It shows a relation between the number of a zero-point of continous closed 1-form and the category with a respect to a cohomology class, through a dynamical system on a original space, homoclinic cycle. A graph state and a graph code respectively are defined based on a mathematical simple graph. In this work, we examine a relation between a graph state and a graph code both obtained from the same graph, and show that a graph state is a superposition of logical qubits of the related graph code. By using the relation, we first discuss that a local complementation which has been used for a graph state can be useful for searching locally equivalent stabilizer codes, and second provide a method to find a stabilizer group of a graph code. Given a complete modular meet-continuous lattice $A$, an inflator on $A$ is a monotone function $d\\\\colon A\\\\rightarrow A$such that $a\\\\leq d(a)$ for all $a\\\\in A$. If $I(A)$ is the set of all inflators on $A$, then $I(A)$ is a complete lattice. Motivated by preradical theory we introduce two operators, the totalizer and the equalizer. We obtain some properties of these operators and see how they are related to the structure of the lattice $A$ and with the concept of dimension. An order-preserving Freiman 2-isomorphism is a map $\\\\phi:X \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\\\phi(a) < \\\\phi(b)$ if and only if $a < b$ and $\\\\phi(a)+\\\\phi(b) = \\\\phi(c)+\\\\phi(d)$ if and only if $a+b=c+d$ for any $a,b,c,d \\\\in X$. We show that for any $A \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{Z}$, if $|A+A| \\\\le K|A|$, then there exists a subset $A\\' \\\\subseteq A$ such that the following holds: $|A\\'| \\\\gg_K |A|$ and there exists an order-preserving Freiman 2-isomorphism $\\\\phi: A\\' \\\\rightarrow [-c|A|,c|A|] \\\\cap \\\\mathbb{Z}$ where $c$ depends only on $K$. Several applications are also presented. Let WAP(A) be the space of all weakly almost periodic functionals on a Banach algebra A. The Banach algebra A for which the natural embedding of A into WAP(A)* is bounded below is called a WAP-algebra. We show that the second dual of a Banach algebra A is a WAP-algebra, under each Arens products, if and only if A** is a dual Banach algebra. This is equivalent to the Arens regularity of A. For a locally compact foundation semigroup S, we show that the absolutely continuous semigroup measure algebra M_a(S) is a WAP-algebra if and only if the measure algebra M_b(S) is so. In this paper, we prove that the double inequality $M_{p}(a,b)<B(a,b)<M_{q}(a,b)% holds for all $a, b>0$ with $a\\\\neq b$ if and only if $p\\\\leq 4\\\\log 2/(4+2\\\\log 2-\\\\pi)=1.2351\\\\cdots$ and $q\\\\geq 4/3$, where $% M_{r}(a,b)=[(a^{r}+b^{r})/2]^{1/r}$ $(r\\\\neq 0)$ and $M_{0}(a,b)=\\\\sqrt{ab}$ is the $r$th power mean, $B(a,b)=Q(a,b)e^{A(a,b)/T(a,b)-1}$ is the S\\\\\\'{a}% ndor-Yang mean, $A(a,b)=(a+b)/2$, $Q(a,b)=\\\\sqrt{(a^{2}+b^{2})/2}$ and $% T(a,b)=(a-b)/[2\\\\arctan((a-b)/(a+b))]$. A set of points a 1 ,. .. , a n fixes a planar convex body K if the points are on bdK, the boundary of K, and if any small move of K brings some point of the set in intK, the interior of K. The points a 1 ,. .. , a n $\\\\in$ bdK almost fix K if, for any neighbourhoods V i of a i (i = 1,. .. , n), there are pairs of points a i , a i $\\\\in$ V i $\\\\cap$ bdK such that a 1 , a 1 ,. .. , a n fix K. This note compares several definitions of these notions and gives first order conditions for a 1 ,. .. , a n $\\\\in$ bdK to fix, and to almost fix, K. A Banach algebra $A$ is said to be zero Lie product determined if every continuous bilinear functional $\\\\varphi \\\\colon A\\\\times A\\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}$ satisfying $\\\\varphi(a,b)=0$ whenever $ab=ba$ is of the form $\\\\varphi(a,b)=\\\\omega(ab-ba)$ for some $\\\\omega\\\\in A^*$. We prove that $A$ has this property provided that any of the following three conditions holds: (i) $A$ is a weakly amenable Banach algebra with property $\\\\mathbb{B}$ and having a bounded approximate identity, (ii) every continuous cyclic Jordan derivation from $A$ into $A^*$ is an inner derivation, (iii) $A$ is the algebra of all $n\\\\times n$ matrices, where $n\\\\ge 2$, over a cyclically amenable Banach algebra with a bounded approximate identity. Let $A$ be an Artin algebra, $M$ be a Gorenstein projective $A$-module and $B =$ End$_A M$, then $M$ is a $A$-$B$-bimodule. We use the restricted flat dimension of $M_B$ to give a characterization of the homological dimensions of $A$ and $B$, and obtain the following main results: (1) if $A$ is a CM-finite algebra with $\\\\cal GP$($A$) = add$_AE$ and fin.dim $A \\\\geq 2,$ then ${\\\\rm fin.dim}\\\\ B \\\\leq {\\\\rm fin.dim}\\\\ A + {\\\\rm rfd}(M_B) +{\\\\rm pd}_B{\\\\rm Hom}_A(M, E);$ (2) If $A$ is a CM-finite $n$-Gorenstein algebra with $\\\\cal GP$($A$) = add$_AE$ and $n \\\\geq 2$, then gl.dim $B \\\\leq n + {\\\\rm pd}_B{\\\\rm Hom}_A(M, E).$ In this paper we present a procedure which allows to transform a subset $A$ of $\\\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ into a set $ A\\'$ such that $ |2\\\\hspace{0.15cm}\\\\widehat{} A\\'|\\\\leq|2\\\\hspace{0.15cm}\\\\widehat{} A | $, where $2\\\\hspace{0.15cm}\\\\widehat{} A$ is defined to be the set $\\\\left\\\\{a+b:a\\\\neq b,\\\\;a,b\\\\in A\\\\right\\\\}$. From this result, we get some lower bounds for $ |2\\\\hspace{0.15cm}\\\\widehat{} A| $. Finally, we give some remarks related to the problem for which sets $A\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ we have the equality $|2\\\\hspace{0.15cm}\\\\widehat{} A|=2|A|-1$. Let $(Q,\\\\mathfrak n,k)$ be a commutative local Noetherian ring, $f_1,\\\\dots, f_c$ a $Q$-regular sequence in $\\\\mathfrak n$, and $R=Q/(f_1,\\\\dots,f_c)$. Given a complex of finitely generated free $R$-modules, we give a construction of a complex of finitely generated free $Q$-modules having the same homology. A key application is when the original complex is an $R$-free resolution of a finitely generated $R$-module. In this case our construction is a sort of converse to a construction of Eisenbud-Shamash yielding a free resolution of an $R$-module $M$ over $R$ given one over $Q$. For $A \\\\subseteq \\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots\\\\}$, we consider $R(A) = \\\\{a/a\\' : a,a\\' \\\\in A\\\\}$. If $A$ is the set of nonzero values assumed by a quadratic form, when is $R(A)$ dense in the $p$-adic numbers? We show that for a binary quadratic form $Q$, $R(A)$ is dense in $\\\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ if and only if the discriminant of $Q$ is a nonzero square in $\\\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$, and for a quadratic form in at least three variables, $R(A)$ is always dense in $\\\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$. This answers a question posed by several authors in 2017. Let $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space and $A$ a Banach algebra. We investigate amenability properties of the algebra $C(X,A)$ of all $A$-valued continuous functions. We show that $C(X,A)$ has a bounded approximate diagonal if and only if $A$ has a bounded approximate diagonal; if $A$ has a compactly central approximate diagonal (unbounded) then $C(X,A)$ has a compactly approximate diagonal. Weak amenability of $C(X,A)$ for commutative $A$ is also considered. For an $(\\\\epsilon,G)$-color-commutative associative algebra $A$ with an identity element over a field $F$ of characteristic not 2, and for a color-commutative subalgebra $D$ of color-derivations of $A$, denote by $A[D]$ the associative subalgebra of ${\\\\rm End}(A)$ generated by $A$ (regarding as operators on $A$ via left multiplication) and $D$. It is easily proved that, as an associative algebra, $A[D]$ is $G$-graded simple if and only if $A$ is $\\\\G$-graded $D$-simple. Suppose $A$ is $\\\\G$-graded $D$-simple. Then, (a) $A[D]$ is a free left $A$-module; (b) as a Lie color algebra, the subquotient $[A[D],A[D]]/Z(A[D])\\\\cap[A[D],A[D]]$ is simple (except one minor case), where $Z(A[D])$ is the color center of $A[D]$. The structure of this subquotient is explicitly described. We show that if A is a large subset of a box in Z^d with dimensions L_1 >= L_2 >= ... >= L_d which are all reasonably large, then |A + A| > 2^{d/48}|A|. By combining this with Chang\\'s quantitative version of Freiman\\'s theorem, we prove a structural result about sets with small sumset. If A is a set of integers with |A + A| <= K|A|, then there is a progression P of dimension d << log K such that |A \\\\cap P| >= \\\\exp(-K^C)max (|A|, |P|). This is closely related to a theorem of Freiman and Bilu, but is quantitatively stronger in certain aspects. [Added Oct 14th: I have temporarily withdrawn this paper, since Tao and I have realised that a much stronger result follows by applying compressions (and the Brunn-Minkowski theorem). This observation was inspired by a paper of Bollobas and Leader which we were previously unaware of. At some point soon this paper will be reinstated to prove just the result that if A is a subset of R^d containing {0,1}^d then |A + A| >= 2^{d/48}|A|, which may (possibly) be of independent interest. Also soon, the joint paper of Tao and I should become available. ] Let $A$ be a finitary algebra over a finite field $k$, and $A$-$mod$ the category of finite dimensional left $A$-modules. Let $\\\\mathcal{H}(A)$ be the corresponding Hall algebra, and for a positive integer $r$ let $D_{r}(A)$ be the subspace of $\\\\mathcal{H}(A)$ which has a basis consisting of isomorphism classes of modules in $A$-$mod$ with at least $r+1$ indecomposable direct summands. If $A$ is hereditary of type $A_{n}$, then $D_{r}(A)$ is known to be the kernel of the map from the twisted Hall algebra to the quantized Schur algebra indexed by $n+1$ and $r$. For any $A$, we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for $D_{r}(A)$ to be an ideal and some conditions for $D_{r}(A)$ to be a subring of $\\\\mathcal{H}(A)$. For $A$ the path algebra of a quiver, we also determine necessary and sufficient conditions for $D_{r}(A)$ to be a subring of $\\\\mathcal{H}(A)$. Let $t\\\\geq 1$, let $A$ and $B$ be finite, nonempty subsets of an abelian group $G$, and let $A\\\\pp{i} B$ denote all the elements $c$ with at least $i$ representations of the form $c=a+b$, with $a\\\\in A$ and $b\\\\in B$. For $|A|, |B|\\\\geq t$, we show that either \\\\be\\\\label{almost}\\\\Sum{i=1}{t}|A\\\\pp{i} B|\\\\geq t|A|+t|B|-2t^2+1,\\\\ee or else there exist $A\\'\\\\subseteq A$ and $B\\'\\\\subseteq B$ with \\\\ber \\\\nn l&:=&|A\\\\setminus A\\'|+|B\\\\setminus B\\'|\\\\leq t-1, \\\\nn A\\'\\\\pp{t}B\\'&=&A\\'+B\\'=A\\\\pp{t}B,{and} \\\\nn \\\\Sum{i=1}{t}|A\\\\pp{i}B|&\\\\geq& t|A|+t|B|-(t-l)(|H|-\\\\rho)-tl\\\\geq t|A|+t|B|-t|H|,\\\\eer where $H$ is the (nontrivial) stabilizer of $A\\\\pp{t} B$ and $\\\\rho=|A\\'+H|-|A\\'|+|B\\'+H|-|B\\'|$. In the case $t=2$, we improve (\\\\ref{almost}) to $|A\\\\pp{1}B|+|A\\\\pp{2}B|\\\\geq 2|A|+2|B|-4$. We give a two step method to study certain questions regarding associated graded module of a Cohen-Macaulay (CM) module $M$ w.r.t an $\\\\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal $\\\\mathfrak{a}$ in a complete Noetherian local ring $(A,\\\\mathfrak{m})$. The first step, we call it Gorenstein approximation, enables us to reduce to the case when both $A$, $ G_\\\\mathfrak{a}(A) = \\\\bigoplus_{n \\\\geq 0} \\\\mathfrak{a}^n/\\\\mathfrak{a}^{n+1} $ are Gorenstein and $M$ is a maximal CM $A$-module. The second step consists of analyzing the classical filtration $\\\\{Hom_A(M,\\\\mathfrak{a}^n) \\\\}_{\\\\mathbb{Z}}$ of the dual $Hom_A(M,A)$. We give many applications of this point of view. For instance let $(A,\\\\mathfrak{m})$ be equicharacteristic and CM. Let $a(G_\\\\mathfrak{a}(A))$ be the $a$-invariant of $G_\\\\mathfrak{a}(A)$. We prove: 1. $a(G_\\\\mathfrak{a}(A)) = -\\\\dim A$ iff $\\\\mathfrak{a}$ is generated by a regular sequence. 2. If $\\\\mathfrak{a}$ is integrally closed and $a(G_\\\\mathfrak{a}(A)) = -\\\\dim A + 1$ then $\\\\mathfrak{a}$ has minimal multiplicity. We extend to modules a result of Ooishi relating symmetry of $h$-vectors. In this paper, we present the greatest values $\\\\alpha$, $\\\\lambda$ and $p$, and the least values $\\\\beta$, $\\\\mu$ and $q$ such that the double inequalities $\\\\alpha D(a,b)+(1-\\\\alpha)H(a,b)<T(a,b)<\\\\beta D(a,b)+(1-\\\\beta) H(a,b)$, $\\\\lambda D(a,b)+(1-\\\\lambda)H(a,b)<C(a,b)<\\\\mu D(a,b)+(1-\\\\mu) H(a,b)$ and $p D(a,b)+(1-p)H(a,b)<Q(a,b)<q D(a,b)+(1-q)H(a,b)$ hold for all $a,b>0$ with $a\\\\neq b$, where $H(a,b)=2ab/(a+b)$, $T(a,b)=(a-b)/[2\\\\arctan((a-b)/(a+b))]$, $Q(a,b)=\\\\sqrt{(a^2+b^2)/2}$, $C(a,b)=(a^2+b^2)/(a+b)$ and $D(a,b)=(a^3+b^3)/(a^2+b^2)$ are the harmonic, Seiffert, quadratic, first contraharmonic and second contraharmonic means of $a$ and $b$, respectively. A dynamical system is a triple $(A,G,\\\\alpha)$, consisting of a unital locally convex algebra $A$, a topological group $G$ and a group homomorphism $\\\\alpha:G\\\\rightarrow\\\\Aut(A)$, which induces a continuous action of $G$ on $A$. Further, a unital locally convex algebra $A$ is called continuous inverse algebra, or CIA for short, if its group of units $A^{\\\\times}$ is open in $A$ and the inversion $\\\\iota:A^{\\\\times}\\\\rightarrow A^{\\\\times},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,a\\\\mapsto a^{-1}$ is continuous at $1_A$. For a compact manifold $M$, the Fr\\\\\\'echet algebra of smooth functions $C^{\\\\infty}(M)$ is the prototype of such a continuous inverse algebra. We show that if $A$ is a complete commutative CIA, $G$ a compact group and $(A,G,\\\\alpha)$ a dynamical system, then each character of $B:=A^G$ can be extended to a character of $A$. In particular, the natural map on the level of the corresponding spectra $\\\\Gamma_A\\\\rightarrow\\\\Gamma_B$, $\\\\chi\\\\mapsto\\\\chi_{\\\\mid B}$ is surjective. In this paper, we find the greatest values $\\\\alpha$ and $\\\\lambda$, and the least values $\\\\beta$ and $\\\\mu$ such that the double inequalities $$C^{\\\\alpha}(a,b)A^{1-\\\\alpha}(a,b)<M(a,b)<C^{\\\\beta}(a,b)A^{1-\\\\beta}(a,b)$$ and &[C(a,b)/6+5 A(a,b)/6]^{\\\\lambda}[C^{1/6}(a,b)A^{5/6}(a,b)]^{1-\\\\lambda}<M(a,b) &\\\\qquad<[C(a,b)/6+5 A(a,b)/6]^{\\\\mu}[C^{1/6}(a,b)A^{5/6}(a,b)]^{1-\\\\mu} hold for all $a,b>0$ with $a\\\\neq b$, where $M(a,b)$, $A(a,b)$ and $C(a,b)$ denote the Neuman-S\\\\\\'andor, arithmetic, and contra-harmonic means of $a$ and $b$, respectively. Let $(H, \\\\a)$ be a monoidal Hom-Hopf algebra and $(A, \\\\b)$ a right $(H, \\\\a)$-Hom-comodule algebra. We first investigate the criterion for the existence of a total integral of $(A, \\\\b)$ in the setting of monoidal Hom-Hopf algebras. Also we prove that there exists a total integral $\\\\phi: (H, \\\\a)\\\\rightarrow (A, \\\\b)$ if and only if any representation of the pair $(H,A)$ is injective in a functorial way, as a corepresentation of $(H, \\\\a)$, which generalizes Doi\\'s result. Finally, we define a total quantum integral $\\\\g: H\\\\rightarrow Hom(H, A)$ and prove the following affineness criterion: if there exists a total quantum integral $\\\\g$ and the canonical map $\\\\psi: A\\\\o_{B}A\\\\rightarrow A\\\\o H,\\\\ \\\\ a\\\\o_{B}b\\\\mapsto \\\\b^{-1}(a)b_{[0]}\\\\o \\\\a(b_{[1]}) $is surjective, then the induction functor $A\\\\o_B-: \\\\widetilde{\\\\mathscr{H}}(\\\\mathscr{M}_k)_{B}\\\\rightarrow \\\\widetilde{\\\\mathscr{H}}(\\\\mathscr{M}_k)^{H}_{A}$ is an equivalence of categories. A generalized Hermitian (GH-) algebra is a generalization of the partially ordered Jordan algebra of all Hermitian operators on a Hilbert space. We introduce the notion of a gh-tribe, which is a commutative GH-algebra of functions on a nonempty set $X$ with pointwise partial order and operations, and we prove that every commutative GH-algebra is the image of a gh-tribe under a surjective GH-morphism. Using this result, we prove each element $a$ of a GH-algebra $A$ corresponds to a real observable $\\\\xi_a$ on the $\\\\sigma$-orthomodular lattice of projections in $A$ and that $\\\\xi_a$ determines the spectral resolution of $a$. Also, if $f$ is a continuous function defined on the spectrum of $a$, we formulate a definition of $f(a)$, thus obtaining a continuous functional calculus for $A$. This article introduces planar shape signatures derived from homology nerves, which are intersecting 1-cycles in a collection of homology groups endowed with a proximal relator (set of nearness relations) that includes a descriptive proximity. A 1-cycle is a closed, connected path with a zero boundary in a simplicial complex covering a finite, bounded planar shape. The signature of a shape sh A (denoted by sig(sh A)) is a feature vector that describes sh A. A signature sig(sh A) is derived from the geometry, homology nerves, Betti number, and descriptive CW topology on the shape sh A. Several main results are given, namely, (a) every finite, bounded planar shape has a signature derived from the homology group on the shape, (b) a homology group equipped with a proximal relator defines a descriptive Leader uniform topology and (c) a description of a homology nerve and union of the descriptions of the 1-cycles in the nerve have same homotopy type. Given a finite set $A\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\backslash \\\\{0\\\\}$, define \\\\begin{align*}&A\\\\cdot A \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\{a_i\\\\cdot a_j\\\\,|\\\\, a_i,a_j\\\\in A\\\\},\\\\\\\\ &A/A \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\{a_i/a_j\\\\,|\\\\,a_i,a_j\\\\in A\\\\},\\\\\\\\ &A + A \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\{a_i + a_j\\\\,|\\\\, a_i,a_j\\\\in A\\\\},\\\\\\\\ &A - A \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\{a_i - a_j\\\\,|\\\\,a_i,a_j\\\\in A\\\\}.\\\\end{align*} The set $A$ is said to be MPTQ (more product than quotient) if $|A\\\\cdot A|>|A/A|$ and MSTD (more sum than difference) if $|A + A|>|A - A|$. Since multiplication and addition are commutative while division and subtraction are not, it is natural to think that MPTQ and MSTD sets are very rare. However, they do exist. This paper first shows an efficient search for MPTQ subsets of $\\\\{1,2,\\\\ldots,n\\\\}$ and proves that as $n\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty$, the proportion of MPTQ subsets approaches $0$. Next, we prove that MPTQ sets of positive numbers must have at least $8$ elements, while MPTQ sets of both negative and positive numbers must have at least $5$ elements. Finally, we investigate several sequences that do not have MPTQ subsets. In general, the tensor product, $A\\\\otimes B$, of the lattices A and B with zero is not a lattice (it is only a join-semilattice with zero). If $A \\\\otimes B$ is a capped tensor product, then $A \\\\otimes B$ is a lattice (the converse is not known). In this paper, we investigate lattices A with zero enjoying the property that $A \\\\otimes B$ is a capped tensor product, for every lattice B with zero; we shall call such lattices amenable. The &#64257;rst author introduced in 1966 the concept of a sharply transferable lattice. In 1972, H. Gaskill [5] de&#64257;ned, similarly, sharply transferable semilattices, and characterized them by a very e&#64256;ective condition (T). We prove that a &#64257;nite lattice A is amenable iff it is sharply transferable as a join-semilattice. For a general lattice A with zero, we obtain the result: A is amenable iff A is locally &#64257;nite and every &#64257;nite sublattice of A is transferable as a join-semilattice. This yields, for example, that a &#64257;nite lattice A is amenable iff $A\\\\otimes F(3)$ is a lattice iff A satis&#64257;es (T), with respect to $\\\\jj$. In particular, $M3 \\\\otimes F(3)$ is not a lattice. This solves a problem raised by R. W. Quackenbush in 1985 whether the tensor product of lattices with zero is always a lattice. We describe a paradigm for measuring a single electron spin in a solid. This is a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics. The technique can be used to read a spin qubit relatively non-invasively in either a spintronic quantum gate or a spintronic quantum memory. The spin reader can be self assembled by simple electrochemical techniques and can be integrated with a quantum gate. Arbitrarily sparse sets A of integers are constructed with the property that every integer can be represented uniquely in the form n = a + a\\', where a and a\\' belong to the set A and a < a\\' or a = a\\'. Some related open problems are stated. Let $H$ be a Hilbert space. For a closed convex body $A$ denote by $r(A)$ the supremum of radiuses of balls, contained in $A$. We prove, that $\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty r(A_n) \\\\ge r(A)$ for every covering of a convex closed body $A \\\\subset H$ by a sequence of convex closed bodies $A_n$, $n \\\\in \\\\N$. It looks like this fact is new even for triangles in a 2-dimensional space. A realization of a virtual link diagram is obtained by choosing over/under markings for each virtual crossing. Any realization can also be obtained from some representation of the virtual link. (A representation of a virtual link is a link diagram on an oriented 2-dimensional surface.) We prove that if a minimal genus representation meets certain criteria then there is a minimal genus representation resulting in a knotted realization. We give a sufficient condition for a branched surface in a 3 dimensional manifold to fully carry a lamination, giving a piece of answer to a classical question of D. Gabai. For a family of random walks $\\\\{S^{(a)}\\\\}$ satisfying $\\\\mathbf{E}S_1^{(a)}=-a<0$ we consider ladder epochs $\\\\tau^{(a)}=\\\\min\\\\{k\\\\geq1: S_k^{(a)}<0\\\\}$. We study the asymptotic, as $a\\\\to0$, behaviour of $\\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\tau^{(a)}>n)$ in the case when $n=n(a)\\\\to\\\\infty$. As a consequence we obtain also the growth rates of the moments of $\\\\tau^{(a)}$. For a C$^{*}$-bialgebra $A$ with a comultiplication $\\\\Delta$, a universal $R$-matrix of $(A,\\\\Delta)$ is defined as a unitary element in the multiplier algebra $M(A\\\\otimes A)$ of $A\\\\otimes A$ which is an intertwiner between $\\\\Delta$ and its opposite comultiplication $\\\\Delta^{op}$. We show that there exists no universal $R$-matrix for some C$^{*}$-bialgebras. Let $\\\\A$ and $\\\\B$ be unital Banach algebras and $\\\\phi\\\\colon\\\\A\\\\to\\\\B$ be a unital continuous homomorphism. We prove that if $\\\\phi$ is relatively spectral (i.e., there is a dense subalgebra $X$ of $\\\\A$ such that $\\\\sp_\\\\B(\\\\phi(a))=\\\\sp_\\\\A(a)$ for every $a\\\\in X$) and has dense range, then $\\\\phi$ induces monomorphisms from $K_i(\\\\A)$ to $K_i(\\\\B)$, $i=0,1$. Given a Banach space $A$ and fix a non-zero $\\\\varphi\\\\in A^*$ with $\\\\|\\\\varphi\\\\|\\\\leq 1$. Then the product $a\\\\cdot b=\\\\langle\\\\varphi, a\\\\rangle\\\\ b$ turning $A$ into a Banach algebra which will be denoted by $_\\\\varphi A.$ Some of the main properties of $_\\\\varphi A$ such as Arens regularity, $n$-weak amenability and semi-simplicity are investigated. We provide a general approach to construct a stochastic process with a given consistent family of finite dimensional distributions under a nonlinear expectation space. We use this approach to construct a generalized Gaussian process under a sublinear expectation and a q-Brownian motion. The later one is under a complex-valued linear expectation, with which a new type of Feynman-Kac formula can be derived to represent the solution of a Schr\\\\\"odinger equation. A wheel is a graph formed by a chordless cycle and a vertex that has at least three neighbors in the cycle. We prove that every 3-connected graph that does not contain a wheel as a subgraph is in fact minimally 3-connected. We give a new proof of a theorem of Thomassen and Toft: every graph that does not contain a wheel as a subgraph is 3-colorable. Non-self-adjoint Schrodinger operators A which correspond to non-symmetric zero-range potentials are investigated. For a given A, the description of non-real eigenvalues, spectral singularities and exceptional points are obtained; the possibility of interpretation of A as a self-adjoint operator in a Krein space is studied, the problem of similarity of A to a self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space is solved. In this paper, we consider the Wiener Hopf algebra, denoted $\\\\mathcal{W}(A,P,G,\\\\alpha)$, associated to an action of a discrete subsemigroup $P$ of a group $G$ on a $C^{*}$-algebra $A$. We show that $\\\\mathcal{W}(A,P,G,\\\\alpha)$ can be represented as a groupoid crossed product. As an application, we show that when $P=\\\\mathbb{F}_{n}^{+}$, the free semigroup on $n$ generators, the $K$-theory of $\\\\mathcal{W}(A,P,G,\\\\alpha)$ and the $K$-theory of $A$ coincides. We prove existence and uniqueness of travelling waves for a reaction-diffusion system coupling a classical reaction-diffusion equation in a strip with a diffusion equation on a line. To do this we use a continuation method which leads to further insight into the system. In particular, the transition occurs through a singular perturbation which seems new in this context, connecting the system with a Wentzell type boundary value problem. Let $G$ be a finite group having a factorisation $G=AB$ into subgroups $A$ and $B$ with $B$ cyclic and $A\\\\cap B=1,$ and let $b$ be a generator of $B$. The associated skew-morphism is the bijective mapping $f:A \\\\to A$ well defined by the equality $baB=f(a)B$ where $a\\\\in A$. In this paper, we shall classify all skew-morphisms of cyclic $p$-groups where $p$ is an odd prime. We prove, combinatorially, that the product of a Schubert polynomial by a Stanley symmetric polynomial is a truncated Schubert polynomial. Using Monk\\'s rule, we derive a nonnegative combinatorial formula for the Schubert polynomial expansion of a truncated Schubert polynomial. Combining these results, we give a nonnegative combinatorial rule for the product of a Schubert and a Schur polynomial in the Schubert basis. A spectrahedron is a set defined by a linear matrix inequality. A projection of a spectrahedron is often called a semidefinitely representable set. We show that the convex hull of a finite union of such projections is again a projection of a spectrahedron. This improves upon the result of Helton and Nie, who prove the same result in the case of bounded sets. In this paper, an alternate module $(A,\\\\phi)$ is a finite abelian group $A$ with a $\\\\mathbb{Z}$-bilinear application $\\\\phi:A\\\\times A\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{Q}/\\\\mathbb{Z}$ which is alternate (i.e. zero on the diagonal). We shall prove that any alternate module is subsymplectic, i.e. if $(A,\\\\phi)$ has a Lagrangian of cardinal $n$ then there exists an abelian group $B$ of order $n$ such that $(A,\\\\phi)$ is a submodule of the standard symplectic module $B\\\\times B^*$. A functional version of the Kato one-parametric regularisation for the construction of a dynamical semigroup generator of a relative bound one perturbation is introduced. It does not require that the minus generator of the unperturbed semigroup is a positivity preserving operator. The regularisation is illustrated by an example of a boson-number cut-off regularisation. Let $A$ be the one point extension of an algebra $B$ by a projective $B$-module. We prove that the extension of a given support $\\\\tau$-tilting $B$-module is a support $\\\\tau$-tilting $A$-module; and, conversely, the restriction of a given support $\\\\tau$-tilting $A$-module is a support $\\\\tau$-tilting $B$-module. Moreover, we prove that there exists a full embedding of quivers between the corresponding poset of support $\\\\tau$-tilting modules. We prove that the Fourier space of a hypergroup constructed from a conditional expectation on a locally compact group has a Banach algebra structure. We give an upper bound for the dimension of a germ of a totally geodesic submanifold, and hence of a Shimura variety of A_{g-1}, contained in the Prym locus. First we give such a bound for a germ passing through a Prym variety of a k-gonal curve in terms of the gonality k. Then we deduce a bound only depending on the genus g. We describe Dirac structures on surfaces and 3-manifolds. Every Dirac structure on a surface $M$ is described either by a regular 1-foliation or by a section of a circle bundle obtained as a fiberwise compactification of the line bundle $\\\\wedge^2TM$. Every Dirac structure on a 3-manifold $M$ is either the union of a presymplectic manifold and a foliated Poisson manifold, or the union of a Poisson manifold and a foliated presymplectic manifold. Let $A$ be a finite subset of a field $\\\\mathbb{F}$ and $D_n(A)$ be a set of all matrices with entries in $A$, namely $$ D_n(A)=\\\\{D\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}\\\\ |\\\\ \\\\exists a_{ij}\\\\in A, 1 \\\\le i,j \\\\le n, \\\\det\\\\bigl((a_{ij})\\\\bigr)=D\\\\}, $$ where the symbol $(a_{ij})$ defines the matrix with elements $a_{ij}$. How big is the size of the set $D_n(A)$ comparing to the size of the set $A$? We show that if $U\\\\subset\\\\partial A$ is a neighbourhood of a point $x_0\\\\in\\\\partial A$ of the boundary of a convex body $A$ then it has the so-called Stainhaus-type property (the interior of $(U+U)$ is nonempty) if and only if $x_0$ is not a point of flatness of the boundary~$\\\\partial A$. This implies that additive functions as well as mid-convex functions, bounded above on~$U$, are continuous. Let $\\\\mathbb{F}_p$ be a prime field of order $p,$ and $A$ be a set in $\\\\mathbb{F}_p$ with $|A| \\\\leq p^{1/2}.$ In this note, we show that \\\\[\\\\max\\\\{|A+A|, |f(A, A)|\\\\}\\\\gtrsim |A|^{\\\\frac{6}{5}+\\\\frac{4}{305}},\\\\] where $f(x, y)$ is a non-degenerate quadratic polynomial in $\\\\mathbb{F}_p[x, y].$ This improves a recent result given by Koh, Mojarrad, Pham, Valculescu (2018). A basic measure of the combinatorial complexity of a convexity space is its Radon number. In this paper we show a fractional Helly theorem for convexity spaces with a bounded Radon number, answering a question of Kalai. As a consequence we also get a weak epsilon-net theorem for convexity spaces with a bounded Radon number. This answers a question of Bukh and extends a recent result of Moran and Yehudayoff. Elmendorf\\'s Theorem states that the category of continuous actions of a topological group is a Grothendieck topos in the sense that it is equivalent to a category of sheaves on a site. This paper offers a 2-dimensional generalization by showing that a certain 2-category of continuous actions of a topological 2-group is 2-equivalent to a 2-category of 2-sheaves on a suitable 2-site. Let $f$ be a smooth real function with strictly monotone first $k$ derivatives. We show that for a finite set $A$, with $|A+A|\\\\leq K|A|$, $|2^kf(A)-(2^k-1)f(A)|\\\\gg_k |A|^{k+1-o(1)}/K^{O_k(1)}$. We deduce several new sum-product type implications, e.g. that $A+A$ being small implies unbounded growth for a many enough times iterated product set $A \\\\cdots A$. Let $W\\\\subset O(V)$ be the Weyl group of a root system $R\\\\subset V$. If $a + b + c = 0 = a\\' + b\\' + c\\'$ with $a, b$ and $c$ respectively conjugated to $a\\', b\\'$ and $c\\'$ in $V$ , then $(a, b, c)$ is conjugated to $(a\\', b\\', c\\')$ in $V^3$ when each projection of $a$ to an irreducible component of $V$ is co-linear to a minuscule coweight. Let $A$ be a unital AH-algebra and let $\\\\alpha\\\\in Aut(A)$ be an automorphism. A necessary condition for $A\\\\rtimes_{\\\\alpha}\\\\Z$ being embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra is the existence of a faithful tracial state. If in addition, there is an automorphism $\\\\kappa$ with $\\\\kappa_{*1}=-{\\\\rm id}_{K_1(A)}$ such that $\\\\alpha\\\\circ \\\\kappa$ and $\\\\kappa\\\\circ \\\\af$ are asymptotically unitarily equivalent, then $A\\\\rtimes_{\\\\af}\\\\Z$ can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra. Consequently, in the case that $A$ is a unital AH-algebra (not necessarily simple) with torsion $K_1(A),$ $A\\\\rtimes_{\\\\alpha}\\\\Z$ can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra if and only if $A$ admits a faithful $\\\\alpha$-invariant tracial state. We also show that if $A$ is a unital A$\\\\T$-algebra then $A\\\\rtimes_{\\\\alpha}\\\\Z$ can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra if and only if $A$ admits a faithful $\\\\af$-invariant tracial state. If $X$ is a compact metric space and $\\\\Lambda: \\\\Z^2\\\\to Aut(C(X))$ is a \\\\hm then $C(X)\\\\rtimes_{\\\\Lambda}\\\\Z^2$ can be asymptotically embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra provided that $X$ admits a strictly positive $\\\\Lambda$-invariant probability measure. Consequently $C(X)\\\\rtimes_{\\\\Lambda}\\\\Z^2$ is quasidiagonal if $X$ admits a strictly positive $\\\\Lambda$-invariant Borel probability measure. A semiring is an algebraic structure similar to a ring, but without the requirement that each element must have an additive inverse. A po-semiring is a semiring equipped with a compatible bounded partial order. In this paper, properties of zero divisors and prime elements of a po-semiring are studied. In particular, it is proved that under some mild assumption the set $Z(A)$ of nonzero zero divisors of $A$ is $A\\\\setminus \\\\{0,1\\\\}$, each prime element of $A$ is a maximal element, and the zero divisor graph $\\\\G(A)$ of $A$ is a finite graph if and only if $A$ is finite. For a po-semiring $A$ with $Z(A)=A\\\\setminus \\\\{0,1\\\\}$, it is proved that $A$ has finitely many maximal elements if ACC holds either for elements of $A$ or for principal annihilating ideals of $A$. As applications of prime elements, it is shown that the structure of a po-semiring $A$ is completely determined by the structure of integral po-semirings if either $|Z(A)|=1$ or $|Z(A)|=2$ and $Z(A)^2\\\\not=0$. Applications to the ideal structure of commutative rings are considered. The effects of a magnetic field on a modulated phase is studied. A modulated phase is found to have two critical fields $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$. For a large enough magnetic field. $H_1$ can be approximated by a linear law. As a result, the minimum magnetic field needed to destroy a modulated phase is a constant. The minimum magnetic field also greatly depends on the order of a commensurate. A very high order commensurate phase and an incommensurate phase are impossible to survive a magnetic field. The behaviour of a magnetoelastic chain in a magnetic field is can be described by a harmless Devil\\'s staircase. The inverse temperature is found to play a role similar to that of a special magnetic field. The deeper physics underlying these new phenomena is the breaking of the left-right symmetry of a phase diagram. As a result a controllable path to a modulated phase is found. The base-$k$ {\\\\em Copeland-Erd\\\\\"os sequence} given by an infinite set $A$ of positive integers is the infinite sequence $\\\\CE_k(A)$ formed by concatenating the base-$k$ representations of the elements of $A$ in numerical order. This paper concerns the following four quantities. The {\\\\em finite-state dimension} $\\\\dimfs (\\\\CE_k(A))$, a finite-state version of classical Hausdorff dimension introduced in 2001. The {\\\\em finite-state strong dimension} $\\\\Dimfs(\\\\CE_k(A))$, a finite-state version of classical packing dimension introduced in 2004. This is a dual of $\\\\dimfs(\\\\CE_k(A))$ satisfying $\\\\Dimfs(\\\\CE_k(A))$ $\\\\geq \\\\dimfs(\\\\CE_k(A))$. The {\\\\em zeta-dimension} $\\\\Dimzeta(A)$, a kind of discrete fractal dimension discovered many times over the past few decades. The {\\\\em lower zeta-dimension} $\\\\dimzeta(A)$, a dual of $\\\\Dimzeta(A)$ satisfying $\\\\dimzeta(A)\\\\leq \\\\Dimzeta(A)$. We prove the following. $\\\\dimfs(\\\\CE_k(A))\\\\geq \\\\dimzeta(A)$. This extends the 1946 proof by Copeland and Erd\\\\\"os that the sequence $\\\\CE_k(\\\\mathrm{PRIMES})$ is Borel normal. $\\\\Dimfs(\\\\CE_k(A))\\\\geq \\\\Dimzeta(A)$. These bounds are tight in the strong sense that these four quantities can have (simultaneously) any four values in $[0,1]$ satisfying the four above-mentioned inequalities. Theorem (after Giraud, SGA 4): Suppose $A$ is a simplicial category. The following conditions are equivalent: (i) There is a cofibrantly generated closed model category $M$ such that $A$ is equivalent to the Dwyer-Kan simplicial localization $L(M)$; (ii) $A$ admits all small homotopy colimits, and there is a small subset of objects of $A$ which are $A$-small, and which generate $A$ by homotopy colimits; (iii) There exists a small 1-category $C$ and a morphism $g:C\\\\to A$ sending objects of $C$ to $A$-small objects, which induces a fully faithful inclusion $i:A\\\\to \\\\hat{C}$, such that $i$ admits a left homotopy-adjoint $\\\\psi$. We call a Segal category $A$ which satisfies these equivalent conditions, an $\\\\infty$-pretopos. Note that (i) implies that $A$ admits all small homotopy limits too. If furthermore there exists $C\\\\to A$ as in (iii) such that the adjoint $\\\\psi$ preserves finite homotopy limits, then we say that $A$ is an ``$\\\\infty$-topos\\'\\'. Given a definite nonnegative matrix $A \\\\in M_n (C)$, we study the minimal index of A: $I(A) = \\\\max \\\\{\\\\lambda \\\\ge 0 : A\\\\circ B \\\\ge \\\\lambda B$ for all $0\\\\le B\\\\}$, where $A\\\\circ B$ denotes the Hadamard product $(A\\\\circ B)_{ij} = A_{ij} B_{ij}$. For any unitary invariant norm N in $M_n(C)$, we consider the N-index of A: $I(N,A) = \\\\min\\\\{N(A\\\\circ B) : B\\\\ge 0$ and $N(B) = 1 \\\\}$. If A has nonnegative entries, then $I(A) = I(\\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\|_{sp}, A)$ if and only if there exists a vector u with nonnegative entries such that $Au = (1, >..., 1)^T$. We also show that $I(\\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\|_{2}, A)= I(\\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\|_{sp}, {\\\\bar A}\\\\circ A)^{1/2}$. We give formulae for I(N, A), for an arbitrary unitary invariant norm N, when A is a diagonal matrix or a rank 1 matrix. As an application we find, for a bounded invertible selfadjoint operator S on a Hilbert space, the best constant M(S) such that $\\\\|STS + S^{-1} T S^{-1} \\\\| \\\\ge M(S) \\\\|T\\\\| $ for all $0 \\\\le T$. Let (G,d) be a first order differential *-calculus on a *-algebra A. We say that a pair (\\\\pi,F) of a *-representation \\\\pi of A on a dense domain D of a Hilbert space and a symmetric operator F on D gives a commutator representation of G if there exists a linear mapping t:G -> L(D) such that t(adb)=\\\\pi(a)i[F,\\\\pi(b)], a,b in A. Among others, it is shown that each left-covariant *-calculus G of a compact quantum group Hopf *-algebra A has a faithful commutator representation. For a class of bicovariant *-calculi on A there is a commutator representation such that F is the image of a central element of the quantum tangent space. If A is the Hopf *-algebra of the compact form of one of the quantum groups SL_q(n+1), O_q(n), Sp_q(2n) with real transcendental q, then this commutator representation is faithful. Keywords: Quantum Groups; Noncommuative Geometry; Differential Calculus Let A be an abelian category of finite type and homological dimension 1. Then by results of Green R(A), the extended Hall-Ringel algebra of A, has a natural Hopf algebra structure. We consider its Heisenberg double Heis(A) and study its relation with D(A), the derived category of A. We show that Heis(A) can be viewed as a \"Hall algebra\" of D^{0,1}(A), the subcategory of complexes situated in degrees 0 and 1, in the following sense: if B is the heart of a t-structure on D(A) lying in D^{0,1}(A), then R(B) is naturally a subalgebra in Heis(A). Further, we define a new algebra L(A) called the lattice algebra of A, obtained by taking infinitely many copies of R(A), one for each site of an infinite 1-dimensional lattice and imposing Heisenberg double-type relations between copies at adjacent sites and oscillator-type relations between copies at non-adjacent sites. This algebra serves as the \"Hall algebra\" of the full derived category D(A) in the following sense: any derived equivalence D(A)-->D(B) induces an isomorphism of lattice algebras L(A)-->L(B). Given a finite group G acting as automorphisms on a ring A, the skew group ring A*G is an important tool for studying the structure of G-stable ideals of A. The ring A*G is G-graded, i.e.G coacts on A*G. The Cohen-Montgomery duality says that the smash product A*G#k[G]^* of A*G with the dual group ring k[G]^* is isomorphic to the full matrix ring M_n(A) over A, where n is the order of G. In this note we show how much of the Cohen-Montgomery duality carries over to partial group actions in the sense of R.Exel. In particular we show that the smash product (A*_\\\\alpha G)#k[G]^* of the partial skew group ring A*_\\\\alpha G and k[G]^* is isomorphic to a direct product of the form K x eM_n(A)e where e is a certain idempotent of M_n(A) and K is a subalgebra of (A *_\\\\alpha G)#k[G]^*. Moreover A*_\\\\alpha G is shown to be isomorphic to a separable subalgebra of eM_n(A)e. We also look at duality for infinite partial group actions and for partial Hopf actions. Let k be a field and f be a Siegel modular form of weight h \\\\geq 0 and genus g>1 over k. Using f, we define an invariant of the k-isomorphism class of a principally polarized abelian variety (A,a)/k of dimension g. Moreover when (A,a) is the Jacobian of a smooth plane curve, we show how to associate to f a classical plane invariant. As straightforward consequences of these constructions, when g=3 and k is a subfield of the complex field, we obtain (i) a new proof of a formula of Klein linking the modular form \\\\chi_{18} to the square of the discriminant of plane quartics ; (ii) a proof that one can decide when (A,a) is a Jacobian over k by looking whether the value of \\\\chi_{18} at (A,a) is a square in k. This answers a question of J.-P. Serre. Finally, we study the possible generalizations of this approach for g>3. Let $A$, $A\\'$ be separable $C^*$-algebras, $B$ a stable $\\\\sigma$-unital $C^*$-algebra. Our main result is the construction of the pairing $[[A\\',A]]\\\\times\\\\operatorname{Ext}^{-1/2}(A,B)\\\\to\\\\operatorname{Ext}^{-1/2}(A\\',B)$, where $[[A\\',A]]$ denotes the set of homotopy classes of asymptotic homomorphisms from $A\\'$ to $A$ and $\\\\operatorname{Ext}^{-1/2}(A,B)$ is the group of semi-invertible extensions of $A$ by $B$. Assume that all extensions of $A$ by $B$ are semi-invertible. Then this pairing allows us to give a condition on $A\\'$ that provides semi-invertibility of all extensions of $A\\'$ by $B$. This holds, in particular, if $A$ and $A\\'$ are shape equivalent. A similar condition implies that if $\\\\operatorname{Ext}^{-1/2}$ coincides with $E$-theory (via the Connes-Higson map) for $A$ then the same holds for $A\\'$. This paper is a sequel to our earlier work [BFPRW], where we study the derived representation scheme DRep_{g}(A) parametrizing the representations of a Lie algebra A in a finite-dimensional reductive Lie algebra g. In [BFPRW], we defined two canonical maps Tr_{g}(A): HC^{(r)}(A) \\\\to \\\\H[\\\\DRep_{g}(A)]^G and \\\\Phi_{g}(A): H[\\\\DRep_{g}(A)]^G \\\\to H[\\\\DRep_{h}(A)]^W called the Drinfeld trace and the derived Harish-Chandra homomorphism, respectively. In this paper, we give an explicit formula for the Drinfeld trace in terms of Chern-Simons classes of a canonical g-torsor associated to the pair (A, g). Our construction is inspired by (and, in a sense, dual to) the classical construction of `additive regulator maps\\' due to Beilinson and Feigin. As a consequence, we show that, if A is an abelian Lie algebra, the composite map Phi_{g}(A) Tr_{g}(A) is represented by a canonical differential operator acting on differential forms on Sym(A) and depending only on the Cartan data (h, W, P), where P is a W-invariant polynomial on h. We derive a combinatorial formula for this operator that plays an important role in the study of derived commuting schemes in [BFPRW]. In this paper we present new structural information about the multiplier algebra Mult (A) of a sigma-unital purely infinite simple C*-algebra A, by characterizing the positive elements a in Mult(A) that are strict sums of projections belonging to A. If a is not in A and is not a projection, then the necessary and sufficient condition for a to be a strict sum of projections belonging to A is that the norm ||a||>1 and that the essential norm ||a||_ess >=1. Based on a generalization of the Perera-Rordam weak divisibility of separable simple C*-algebras of real rank zero to all sigma-unital simple C*-algebras of real rank zero, we show that every positive element of A with norm greater than 1 can be approximated by finite sums of projections. Based on block tri-diagonal approximations, we decompose any positive element a in Mult(A) with ||a||>1 and ||a||_ess >=1 into a strictly converging sum of positive elements in A with norm greater than 1. We prove a stability version of a general result that bounds the permanent of a matrix in terms of its operator norm. More specifically, suppose $A$ is an $n \\\\times n$ matrix over $\\\\mathbb{C}$ (resp. $\\\\mathbb{R}$), and let $\\\\mathcal{P}$ denote the set of $n \\\\times n$ matrices over $\\\\mathbb{C}$ (resp. $\\\\mathbb{R}$) that can be written as a permutation matrix times a unitary diagonal matrix. Then it is known that the permanent of $A$ satisfies $|\\\\text{perm}(A)| \\\\leq \\\\Vert A \\\\Vert_{2} ^n$ with equality iff $A/ \\\\Vert A \\\\Vert_{2} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{P}$ (where $\\\\Vert A \\\\Vert_2$ is the operator $2$-norm of $A$). We show a stability version of this result asserting that unless $A$ is very close (in a particular sense) to one of these extremal matrices, its permanent is exponentially smaller (as a function of $n$) than $\\\\Vert A \\\\Vert_2 ^n$. In particular, for any fixed $\\\\alpha, \\\\beta > 0$, we show that $|\\\\text{perm}(A)|$ is exponentially smaller than $\\\\Vert A \\\\Vert_2 ^n$ unless all but at most $\\\\alpha n$ rows contain entries of modulus at least $\\\\Vert A \\\\Vert_2 (1 - \\\\beta)$. Let $G$ be a finite $p$-group acted on faithfully by a group $A$. We prove that if $A$ fixes every element of order dividing $p$ ($4$ if $p=2$) in a specified subgroup of $G$, then both $A$ and $[G,A]$ behave regularly, that is the elements of order dividing any power $p^i$ in each one of them form a subgroup; moreover $A$ and $[G,A]$ have the same exponent, and they are nilpotent of class bounded in terms of $p$ and the exponent of $A$. This leads in particular to a solution of a problems posed by Y. Berkovich. In another direction we discuss some aspects of the influence of a $p$-group $P$ on the structure of a finite group which contains $P$ as a Sylow subgroup, under assumptions like every element of order $p$ ($4$ if $p=2$) in a given term of the lower central series of $P$ lies in the center of $P$. We give a survey of the known connections between regularity conditions and amenability conditions in the setting of uniform algebras. For a uniform algebra $A$ we consider the set, $A_{lc}$, of functions in $A$ which are locally constant on a (varying) dense open subset of the character space of $A$. We show that, for a separable uniform algebra $A$, if $A$ has bounded relative units at every point of a dense subset of the character space of $A$, then $A_{lc}$ is dense in $A$. We construct a separable, essential, regular uniform algebra $A$ on its character space $X$ such that every point of $X$ is a peak point for $A$, $A$ has bounded relative units at every point of a dense open subset of $X$ and yet $A$ is not weakly amenable. In particular, this shows that a continuous derivation from a separable, essential uniform algebra $A$ to its dual need not annihilate $A_{lc}$. A Banach space operator $A\\\\in B({\\\\cal{X}})$ is polaroid, $A\\\\in {\\\\cal{P}}$, if the isolated points of the spectrum $\\\\sigma(A)$ are poles of the operator; $A$ is hereditarily polaroid, $A\\\\in{\\\\cal{HP}}$, if every restriction of $A$ to a closed invariant subspace is polaroid. Operators $A\\\\in{\\\\cal{HP}}$ have SVEP on $\\\\Phi_{sf}(A)=\\\\{\\\\lambda: A-\\\\lambda$ is semi Fredholm $\\\\}$: This, in answer to a question posed by Li and Zhou (Studia Math. 221(2014), 175-192), proves the necessity of the condition $\\\\Phi_{sf}^+(A)=\\\\emptyset$. A sufficient condition for $A\\\\in B({\\\\cal{X}})$ to have SVEP on $\\\\Phi_{sf}(A)$ is that its component $\\\\Omega_a(A)=\\\\{\\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\Phi_{sf}(A): \\\\rm{ind}(A-\\\\lambda)\\\\leq 0\\\\}$ is connected. We prove: If $A\\\\in B({\\\\cal{H}})$ is a Hilbert space operator, then a necessary and sufficient condition for there to exist a compact operator $K$ such that $A+K\\\\in{\\\\cal{HP}}$ is that $\\\\Omega_a(A)$ is connected. Given a Banach space operator $A$, the isolated eigenvalues $E(A)$ and the poles $\\\\Pi(A)$ (resp., eigenvalues $E^a(A)$ which are isolated points of the approximate point spectrum and the left ploles $\\\\Pi^a(A)$) of the spectrum of $A$ satisfy $\\\\Pi(A)\\\\subseteq E(A)$ (resp., $\\\\Pi^a(A)\\\\subseteq E^a(A)$), and the reverse inclusion holds if and only if $E(A)$ (resp., $E^a(A)$) has empty intersection with the B-Weyl spectrum (resp., upper B-Weyl spectrum) of $A$. Evidently $\\\\Pi(A)\\\\subseteq E^a(A)$, but no such inclusion exists for $E(A)$ and $\\\\Pi^a(A)$. The study of identities $E(A)=\\\\Pi^a(A)$ and $E^a(A)=\\\\Pi(A)$, and their stability under perturbation by commuting Riesz operators, has been of some interest in the recent past. This paper studies the stability of these identities under perturbation by (non-commuting) compact operators. Examples of analytic Toeplitz operators and operators satisfying the abstract shift condition are considered. Let $A$ be a unital Banach algebra. We give a characterization of the left Banach $A$-modules $X$ for which there exists a commutative unital $C^*$-algebra $C(K)$, a linear isometry $i\\\\colon X\\\\to C(K)$, and a contractive unital homomorphism $\\\\theta\\\\colon A\\\\to C(K)$ such that $i(a\\\\cdotp x) =\\\\theta(a)i(x)$ for any $a\\\\in A, x\\\\in X$. We then deduce a \"commutative\" version of the Christensen-Effros-Sinclair characterization of operator bimodules. In the last section of the paper, we prove a $w^*$-version of the latter characterization, which generalizes some previous work of Effros and Ruan. Over a field $F$ of any characteristic, for a commutative associative algebra $A$ with an identity element and for the polynomial algebra $F[D]$ of a commutative derivation subalgebra $D$ of $A$, the associative and the Lie algebras of Weyl type on the same vector space $A[D]=A\\\\otimes F[D]$ are defined. It is proved that $A[D]$, as a Lie algebra (modular its center) or as an associative algebra, is simple if and only if $A$ is $D$-simple and $A[D]$ acts faithfully on $A$. Thus a lot of simple algebras are obtained. Given $(V_1,V_2)$ a Heegaard splitting of the complement of a composite knot $K=K_1# K_2$ in $S^3$, where $K_i, i=1,2$ are prime knots, we have a unique, up to isotopy, decomposing annulus $A$. When the intersection of $A$ and $V_1$ is a minimal collection of disks we study the components of $V_1-N(A)$ and show that at most one component is a 3-ball meeting $A$ in two disks. This is a crucial step in proving the conjecture that a necessary and sufficient condition for the tunnel number of a connected sum to be less than or equal to the sum of the tunnel numbers is that one of the knots has a Heegaard splitting in which a merdian curve is primitive. We study the classical invariant theory of the Bezoutiant R(A,B) of a pair of binary forms A,B. It is shown that R(A,B) admits a Taylor expansion whose coefficients are (essentially) the odd transvectants (A,B)_{2r+1}. Moreover, R(A,B) is entirely determined by the first two terms M = (A,B)_1, N =(A,B)_3. Using the Plucker relations, we give equivariant formulae which express the higher transvectants (A,B)_5, (A,B)_7 in terms of M,N. We also describe a `reduction formula\\' which calculates B from the knowledge of A and R(A,B). We show two results. First, a refinement of Freiman\\'s theorem: if A is a finite set of integers and |A+A| < K|A|, then A is contained in a multidimensional progression of dimension at most O(K^{7/4} log^3K) and size at most exp(O(K^{7/4} log^3K))|A|. Secondly, an improvement of a result of Konyagin and Laba: if A is a finite set of reals and a is a transcendental then |A+aA| >> |A|(log |A|)^{4/3-\\\\epsilon} for all \\\\epsilon>0. For a cellular algebra $\\\\A$ with a cellular basis $\\\\ZC$, we consider a decomposition of the unit element $1_\\\\A$ into orthogonal idempotents (not necessary primitive) satisfying some conditions. By using this decomposition, the cellular basis $\\\\ZC$ can be partitioned into some pieces with good properties. Then by using a certain map $\\\\a$, we give a coarse partition of $\\\\ZC$ whose refinement is the original partition. We construct a Levi type subalgebra $\\\\aA$ of $\\\\A$ and its quotient algebra $\\\\oA$, and also construct a parabolic type subalgebra $\\\\tA$ of $\\\\A$, which contains $\\\\aA$ with respect to the map $\\\\a$. Then, we study the relation of standard modules, simple modules and decomposition numbers among these algebras. Finally, we study the relationship of blocks among these algebras. Let W be a polyconvex function defined on the 2 x 2 real matrices. The Busemann representative f, say, of W is the largest possible convex representative of W. Writing L for the set of affine functions on R^{5} such that a(A, det A) is less than or equal to W(A) for all 2 x 2 real matrices A, f can then be expressed as f(X) = sup {a(X): a lies in L}. This short note proves the surprising result that f is in general strictly larger than the `natural\\' convex representative g(X) = sup {a(X): a lies in L and a(A, det A)=W(A) for some A}. We study centralizers of elements in domains. We generalize a result of the author and Small, showing that if $A$ is a finitely generated noetherian domain and $a\\\\in A$ is not algebraic over the extended centre of $A$, then the centralizer of $a$ has Gelfand-Kirillov dimension at most one less than the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of $A$. In the case that $A$ is a finitely generated noetherian domain of GK dimension 3 over the complex numbers, we show that the centralizer of an element a $A$ that is not algebraic over the extended centre of $A$ satisfies a polynomial identity. Let $A, B\\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{Z}$ be finite, nonempty subsets with $\\\\min A=\\\\min B=0$, and let $$\\\\delta(A,B)={\\\\begin{array}{ll} 1 & \\\\hbox{if} A\\\\subseteq B, 0 & \\\\hbox{otherwise.} If $\\\\max B\\\\leq \\\\max A\\\\leq |A|+|B|-3$ and \\\\label{one}|A+B|\\\\leq |A|+2|B|-3-\\\\delta(A,B), then we show $A+B$ contains an arithmetic progression with difference 1 and length $|A|+|B|-1$. As a corollary, if \\\\eqref{one} holds, $\\\\max(B)\\\\leq \\\\max(A)$ and either $\\\\gcd(A)=1$ or else $\\\\gcd(A+B)=1$ and $|A+B|\\\\leq 2|A|+|B|-3$, then $A+B$ contains an arithmetic progression with difference 1 and length $|A|+|B|-1$. A $k$-sum of a set $A\\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{Z}$ is an integer that may be expressed as a sum of $k$ distinct elements of $A$. How large can the ratio of the number of $(k+1)$-sums to the number of $k$-sums be? Writing $k\\\\wedge A$ for the set of $k$-sums of $A$ we prove that \\\\[ \\\\frac{|(k+1)\\\\wedge A|}{|k\\\\wedge A|}\\\\, \\\\le \\\\, \\\\frac{|A|-k}{k+1} \\\\] whenever $|A|\\\\ge (k^{2}+7k)/2$. The inequality is tight -- the above ratio being attained when $A$ is a geometric progression. This answers a question of Ruzsa. Let $A$ be a finite set of integers. We show that if $k$ is a prime power or a product of two distinct primes then $$|A+k\\\\cdot A|\\\\geq(k+1)|A|-\\\\lceil k(k+2)/4\\\\rceil$$ provided $|A|\\\\geq (k-1)^{2}k!$, where $A+k\\\\cdot A=\\\\{a+kb:\\\\ a,b\\\\in A\\\\}$. We also establish the inequality $|A+4\\\\cdot A|\\\\geq 5|A|-6 $ for $|A|\\\\geq 5$. Conjectures of Suciu relate the fundamental group of the complement M = C^n\\\\A of a hyperplane arrangement A to the first resonance variety of H^*(M,Z). We describe a connection between the first resonance variety and the Orlik-Terao algebra C(A) of the arrangement. In particular, we show that non-local components of R^1(A) give rise to determinantal syzygies of C(A). As a result, Proj(C(A)) lies on a scroll, placing geometric constraints on R^1(A). The key observation is that C(A) is the homogeneous coordinate ring associated to a nef but not ample divisor on the blowup of P^2 at the singular points of A. Let $A$ be a group isomorphic with either $S_4$, the symmetric group on four symbols, or $D_8$, the dihedral group of order 8. Let $V$ be a normal four-subgroup of $A$ and $\\\\alpha$ an involution in $A\\\\setminus V$. Suppose that $A$ acts on a finite group $G$ in such a manner that $C_G(V)=1$ and $C_G(\\\\alpha)$ has exponent $e$. We show that if $A\\\\cong S_4$ then the exponent of $G$ is $e$-bounded and if $A\\\\cong D_8$ then the exponent of the derived group $G\\'$ is $e$-bounded. This work was motivated by recent results on the exponent of a finite group admitting an action by a Frobenius group of automorphisms. Let $A$ be a DG algebra with a trivial differential over a commutative unital ring. This paper investigates the image of the totaling functor, defined from the category of complexes of graded $A$-modules to the category of DG $A$-modules. Specifically, we exhibit a special class of semifree DG $A$-modules which can always be expressed as the totaling of some complex of graded free $A$-modules. As a corollary, we also provide results concerning the image of the totaling functor when $A$ is a polynomial ring over a field. A uniform space is said to be non-Archimedean if it is generated by equivalence relations. If $\\\\lambda$ is a cardinal, then a non-Archimedean uniform space $(X,\\\\mathcal{U})$ is $\\\\lambda$-totally bounded if each equivalence relation in $\\\\mathcal{U}$ partitions $X$ into less than $\\\\lambda$ blocks. If $A$ is an infinite set, then let $\\\\Omega(A)$ be the algebra with universe $A$ and where each $a\\\\in A$ is a fundamental constant and every finitary function is a fundamental operation. We shall give a duality between complete non-Archimedean $|A|^{+}$-totally bounded uniform spaces and subdirect powers of $\\\\Omega(A)$. We shall apply this duality to characterize the algebras dual to supercomplete non-Archimedean uniform spaces. Let X be a compact Hausdorf space, let A be a commutative unital Banach algebra, and let C(X,A) denote the algebra of continuous A-valued functions on $X$ equipped with the uniform norm ||f||=sup{||f(x)||:x\\\\in X} for all f in C(X,A). Hausner, in [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 8(1957), 246--249], proved that M is a maximal ideal in C(X,A) if and only if there exist a point x in X and a maximal ideal N in A such that M={f in C(X,A) : f(x) in N}. In this note, we give new characterizations of maximal ideals in C(X,A). We also present a short proof of Hausner\\'s result by a different approach. There is a family of constructions to produce orthomodular structures from modular lattices, lattices that are M and M*-symmetric, relation algebras, the idempotents of a ring, the direct product decompositions of a set or group or topological space, and from the binary direct product decompositions of an object in a suitable type of category. We show that an interval [0, a] of such an orthomodular structure constructed from A is again an orthomodular structure constructed from some B built from A. When A is a modular lattice, this B is an interval of A, and when A is an object in a category, this B is a factor of A. An analogue of Hilbert\\'s Syzygy Theorem is proved for the algebra $\\\\mS_n (A)$ of one-sided inverses of the polynomial algebra $A[x_1, ..., x_n]$ over an arbitrary ring $A$: $$ \\\\lgldim (\\\\mS_n(A))= \\\\lgldim (A) +n.$$ The algebra $\\\\mS_n(A)$ is noncommutative, neither left nor right Noetherian and not a domain. The proof is based on a generalization of the Theorem of Kaplansky (on the projective dimension) obtained in the paper. As a consequence it is proved that for a left or right Noetherian algebra $A$: $$ \\\\wdim (\\\\mS_n(A))= \\\\wdim (A) +n.$$ We show that if a finite, large enough subset A of an arbitrary abelian group satisfies the small doubling condition |A + A| < (log |A|)^{1 - epsilon} |A|, then A must contain a three-term arithmetic progression whose terms are not all equal, and A + A must contain an arithmetic progression or a coset of a subgroup, either of which of size at least exp^[ c (log |A|)^{delta} ]. This extends analogous results obtained by Sanders and, respectively, by Croot, Laba and Sisask in the case where the group is that of the integers or a finite field. Let $A$ be a commutative algebra over the field ${\\\\mathbb F}_2 = {\\\\mathbb Z}/2$. We show that there is a natural algebra homomorphism $\\\\ell (A) \\\\to HC^-_*(A)$ which is an isomorphism when $A$ is a smooth algebra. Thus, the functor $\\\\ell$ can be viewed as an approximation of negative cyclic homology and ordinary cyclic homology $HC_*(A)$ is a natural $\\\\ell (A)$-module. In general, there is a spectral sequence $E^2 = L_*(\\\\ell )(A) \\\\Rightarrow HC_*^- (A)$. We find associated approximation functors $\\\\ell^+$ and $\\\\ell^{per}$ for ordinary cyclic homology and periodic cyclic homology, and set up their spectral sequences. Finally, we discuss universality of the approximations. Let $\\\\mathbb{F}_p$ be the field of residue classes modulo a prime number $p$ and let $A$ be a nonempty subset of $\\\\mathbb{F}_p$. In this paper we show that if $|A|\\\\preceq p^{0.5}$, then \\\\[ \\\\max\\\\{|A\\\\pm A|,|AA|\\\\}\\\\succeq|A|^{13/12};\\\\] if $|A|\\\\succeq p^{0.5}$, then \\\\[ \\\\max\\\\{|A\\\\pm A|,|AA|\\\\}\\\\succapprox \\\\min\\\\{|A|^{13/12}(\\\\frac{|A|}{p^{0.5}})^{1/12},|A|(\\\\frac{p}{|A|})^{1/11}\\\\}.\\\\] These results slightly improve the estimates of Bourgain-Garaev and Shen. Sum-product estimates on different sets are also considered. We investigate analytically and numerically eigenfunction statistics in a disordered system on a finite Bethe lattice (Cayley tree). We show that the wave function amplitude at the root of a tree is distributed fractally in a large part of the delocalized phase. The fractal exponents are expressed in terms of the decay rate and the velocity in a problem of propagation of a front between unstable and stable phases. We demonstrate a crucial difference between a loopless Cayley tree and a locally tree-like structure without a boundary (random regular graph) where extended wavefunctions are ergodic. This note provides a generalisation of a recent result by J\\\\\"arvenp\\\\\"a\\\\\"a, J\\\\\"arvenp\\\\\"a\\\\\"a, Koivusalo, Li, and Suomala, (to appear), on the dimension of limsup-sets of random coverings of tori. The result in this note is stronger in the sense that it provides also a large intersection property of the limsup-sets, the assumptions are weaker, and it implies the result of J\\\\\"arvenp\\\\\"a\\\\\"a, J\\\\\"arvenp\\\\\"a\\\\\"a, Koivusalo, Li, and Suomala as a special case. The proof is based on a recent result by Persson and Reeve from 2013. Consider a unital C*-algebra A, a von Neumann algebra M, a unital sub-C*-algebra C of A and a unital *-homomorphism $\\\\pi$ from C to M. Let u: A --> M be a decomposable map (i.e. a linear combination of completely positive maps) which is a C-bimodule map with respect to $\\\\pi$. We show that u is a linear combination of C-bimodule completely positive maps if and only if there exists a projection e in the commutant of $\\\\pi(C)$ such that u is valued in eMe and $e\\\\pi(.)e$ has a completely positive extension A --> eMe. For any differential graded (DG for short) Poisson algebra $A$ given by generators and relations, we give a \"formula\" for computing the universal enveloping algebra $A^e$ of $A$. Moreover, we prove that $A^e$ has a Poincar\\\\\\'e-Birkhoff-Witt basis provided that $A$ is a graded commutative polynomial algebra. As an application of the PBW-basis, we show that a DG symplectic ideal of a DG Poisson algebra $A$ is the annihilator of a simple DG Poisson $A$-module, where $A$ is the DG Poisson homomorphic image of a DG Poisson algebra $R$ whose underlying algebra structure is a graded commutative polynomial algebra. This article introduces a theory of proximal nerve complexes and nerve spokes, restricted to the triangulation of finite regions in the Euclidean plane. A nerve complex is a collection of filled triangles with a common vertex, covering a finite region of the plane. Structures called $k$-spokes, $k\\\\geq 1$, are a natural extension of nerve complexes. A $k$-spoke is the union of a collection of filled triangles that pairwise either have a common edge or a common vertex. A consideration of the closeness of nerve complexes leads to a proximal view of simplicial complexes. A practical application of proximal nerve complexes is given, briefly, in terms of object shape geometry in digital images. For fixed $s\\\\geq 1$ and $t_{1},t_{2}\\\\in(0,1/2)$ we prove that the inequalities $G^{s}(t_{1}a+(1-t_{1})b,t_{1}b+(1-t_{1})a)A^{1-s}(a,b)>AG(a,b)$ and $G^{s}(t_{2}a+(1-t_{2})b,t_{2}b+(1-t_{2})a)A^{1-s}(a,b)>L(a,b)$ hold for all $a,b>0$ with $a\\\\neq b$ if and only if $t_{1}\\\\geq 1/2-\\\\sqrt{2s}/(4s)$ and $t_{2}\\\\geq 1/2-\\\\sqrt{6s}/(6s)$. Here $G(a,b)$, $L(a,b)$, $AG(a,b)$ and $A(a,b)$ are the geometric, logarithmic, arithmetic-geometric and arithmetic means of $a$ and $b$, respectively. We give a necessary and sufficient mean condition for the quotient of two Jensen functionals and define a new class $\\\\Lambda_{f,g}(a, b)$ of mean values where $f, g$ are continuously differentiable convex functions satisfying the relation $f\"(t)=t g\"(t), t\\\\in \\\\Bbb R^+$. Then we asked for a characterization of $f, g$ such that the inequalities $H(a, b)\\\\le \\\\Lambda_{f, g}(a, b)\\\\le A(a, b)$ or $L(a, b)\\\\le \\\\Lambda_{f, g}(a, b)\\\\le I(a, b)$ hold for each positive $a, b$, where $H, A, L, I$ are the harmonic, arithmetic, logarithmic and identric means, respectively. For a subclass of $\\\\Lambda$ with $g\"(t)=t^s, s\\\\in \\\\Bbb R$, this problem is thoroughly solved. The paper presents results of numerical experiments simulating Bloch oscillations of solitons in a deformable molecular chain in a constant electric field. By the example of a homogeneous polynucleotide chain it is shown that the system under consideration can demonstrate complicated dynamical regimes when at the field intensities less than a certain critical value, a soliton as a whole exhibits oscillations, while at the field intensities exceeding the threshold, a soliton turns to a breather which oscillates. It is shown that the motion of a charge in a deformable chain is infinite as contrasted to that in a rigid chain. Given a vector bundle $E$ on an irreducible projective variety $X$ we give a necessary and sufficient criterion for $E$ to be a direct image of a line bundle under an \\\\\\'etale morphism. The criterion in question is the existence of a Cartan subalgebra bundle of the endomorphism bundle $\\\\text{End}(E)$. As a corollary, a criterion is obtained for $E$ to be the direct image of the structure sheaf under an \\\\\\'etale morphism. The direct image of a parabolic line bundle under any ramified covering map has a natural parabolic structure. Given a parabolic vector bundle, we give a similar criterion for it to be a direct image of a parabolic line bundle under a ramified covering map. A quasiantichain is a lattice consisting of a maximum, a minimum, and the atoms of the lattice. The width of a quasiantichian is the number of atoms. For a positive integer $w$ ($\\\\ge 3$), a quasiantichain of width $w$ is denoted by $\\\\mathcal{M}_{w}$. In \\\\cite{BHW2}, it is proved that $\\\\mathcal{M}_{w}$ can be as a Chermak-Delgado lattice of a finite group if and only if $w=1+p^a$ for some positive integer $a$. Let $t$ be the number of abelian atoms in $\\\\mathcal{CD}(G)$. If $t>2$, then, according to \\\\cite{BHW2}, there exists a positive integer $b$ such that $t=p^b+1$. The converse is still an open question. In this paper, we proved that $a=b$ or $a=2b$. Let $A$ be a Banach algebra and $X$ be a compact Hausdorff space. Given homomorphisms $ \\\\sigma \\\\in Hom(A)$ and $\\\\tau \\\\in Hom(C(X, A))$, we introduce induced homomorphisms $\\\\tilde{\\\\sigma}\\\\in Hom(C(X, A)) $ and $\\\\tilde{\\\\tau}\\\\in Hom(A)$, respectively. We study when $\\\\tau$-(weak) amenability of $C(X, A)$ implies $\\\\tilde{\\\\tau}$-(weak) amenability of $A$. We also investigate where $ \\\\sigma$-weak amenability of $A$ yields $\\\\tilde{\\\\sigma}$-weak amenability of $C(X, A)$. An $A$-cellular space is a space built from $A$ and its suspensions, analogously to the way that $CW$-complexes are built from $S^0$ and its suspensions. The $A$-cellular approximation of a space $X$ is an $A$-cellular space $CW_{A}X$ which is closest to $X$ among all $A$-cellular spaces. The $A$-complexity of a space $X$ is an ordinal number that quantifies how difficult it is to build an $A$-cellular approximation of $X$. In this paper, we study spaces with low complexity. In particular we show that if $A$ is a sphere localized at a set of primes then the $A$-complexity of each space $X$ is at most 1. Given a subset $A \\\\subseteq \\\\{0,1\\\\}^n$, let $\\\\mu(A)$ be the maximal ratio between $\\\\ell_4$ and $\\\\ell_2$ norms of a function whose Fourier support is a subset of $A$. We make some simple observations about the connections between $\\\\mu(A)$ and the additive properties of $A$ on one hand, and between $\\\\mu(A)$ and the uncertainty principle for $A$ on the other hand. One application obtained by combining these observations with results in additive number theory is a stability result for the uncertainty principle on the discrete cube. Our more technical contribution is determining $\\\\mu(A)$ rather precisely, when $A$ is a Hamming sphere $S(n,k)$ for all $0 \\\\le k \\\\le n$. We study a singular Hermitian metric of a vector bundle. First, we prove the sheaf of locally square integrable holomorphic sections of a vector bundle with a singular Hermitian metric, which is a higher rank analogy of a multiplier ideal sheaf, is coherent under some assumptions. Second, we prove a Nadel-Nakano type vanishing theorem of a vector bundle with a singular Hermitian metric. We do not use an approximation technique of a singular Hermitian metric. We apply these theorems to a singular Hermitian metric induced by holomorphic sections and a big vector bundle, and we obtain a generalization of Griffiths\\' vanishing theorem. Finally, we show a generalization of Ohsawa\\'s vanishing theorem. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for an operator $A:X\\\\to Y$ on a Banach space having a shrinking FDD to factor through a Banach space $Z$ such that the Szlenk index of $Z$ is equal to the Szlenk index of $A$. We also prove that for every ordinal $\\\\xi\\\\in (0, \\\\omega_1)\\\\setminus\\\\{\\\\omega^\\\\eta: \\\\eta<\\\\omega_1\\\\text{\\\\ a limit ordinal}\\\\}$, there exists a Banach space $\\\\mathfrak{G}_\\\\xi$ having a shrinking basis and Szlenk index $\\\\omega^\\\\xi$ such that for any separable Banach space $X$ and any operator $A:X\\\\to Y$ having Szlenk index less than $\\\\omega^\\\\xi$, $A$ factors through a subspace and through a quotient of $\\\\mathfrak{G}_\\\\xi$, and if $X$ has a shrinking FDD, $A$ factors through $\\\\mathfrak{G}_\\\\xi$. Let $A$ be a unital C$^*$-algebra with unity $1_A$. A pair of elements $0 \\\\le a, b \\\\le 1_A$ in $A$ is said to be \\\\emph{absolutely compatible} if, $\\\\vert a - b \\\\vert + \\\\vert 1_A - a - b \\\\vert = 1_A.$ In this paper we provide a complete description of absolutely compatible pair of strict elements in a von Neumann algebra. The end form of such a pair has a striking resemblance with that of a `generic pair\\' of projections on a complex Hilbert space introduced by Halmos. Let $A$ be a right Ore domain, $Z(A)$ be the center of $A$ and $Q_r(A)$ be the right total ring of fractions of $A$. If $K$ is a field and $A$ is a $K$-algebra, in this short paper we prove that if $A$ is finitely generated and ${\\\\rm GKdim}(A)<{\\\\rm GKdim}(Z(A))+1$, then $Z(Q_r(A))\\\\cong Q(Z(A))$. Many examples that illustrate the theorem are included, most of them within the skew $PBW$ extensions. Let $A$ be an algebra over a commutative ring $k$. We introduce the notion of a coquasitriangular left bialgebroid over $A$ and show that the category of left comodules over such a bialgebroid has a lax braiding. We also investigate a Tannaka type construction of bimonads and bialgebroids. As an application, we establish the Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan (FRT) construction over $A$. Our construction associates a coquasitriangular bialgebroid to a braided object $(M, c)$ in the category of $A$-bimodules such that $M$ is finitely generated and projective as a left $A$-module. A Hopf algebroid version of this construction is also provided. In a recent paper [El 13], M.E. Kahoui has shown that if $R$ is a polynomial ring over $\\\\mathbb{C}$, $A$ an $\\\\mathbb{A}^3$-fibration over $R$, and $W$ a residual variable of $A$ then $A$ is stably polynomial over $R[W]$. In this article we show that the above result holds over any Noetherian domain $R$ provided the module of differentials $\\\\Omega_R(A)$ of the affine fibration $A$ (which is necessarily a projective $A$-module by a theorem of Asanuma) is a stably free $A$-module. A general theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations of a liquid with anisotropic molecules, in the presence of steady simple shear, has been proposed. Correlation theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations of a liquid helium II inside a spherical volume is developed. Is is shown that all but O(x^{23207/23240}) even integers N<x can be written as the sum of a square, a cube, a forth and a fifth power of a prime. We prove the following. Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring, $B$ a finitely generated $R$-algebra, and $A$ a pure $R$-subalgebra of $B$. Then $A$ is finitely generated over $R$. If A is an abelian variety over a number field K, and L is a (possibly infinite) extension of K generated by torsion points of A, then the quotient of A(L) by its torsion subgroup is a free abelian group. We provide a complete motivic decomposition of a twisted form of a smooth hyperplane section of Gr(3,6). This variety is a norm variety corresponding to a (3,3)-symbol. Isolated electrons resting near a helium surface have a spectrum close to that of a quantum-defect atom. A precisely solvable model with Rydberg spectrum is sugguested and discussed. We show that if A is a simply connected, finite, pointed CW-complex then the mapping spaces Map(A, -) are preserved by the localization functors only if A has the rational homotopy type of a wedge of spheres of a fixed dimension. We present another example of a 3-variable polynomial defining a K3-hypersurface and having a logarithmic Mahler measure expressed in terms of a Dirichlet L-series. Let $A$ be a finite set of positive real numbers. We present a sum-division estimate: |A+A|^2|A/A|\\\\geq\\\\frac{|A|^4}{4}. Let $A$ and $B$ be unital separable simple amenable \\\\CA s which satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem. Suppose {that} $A$ and $B$ are $\\\\mathcal Z$-stable and are of rationally tracial rank no more than one. We prove the following: Suppose that $\\\\phi, \\\\psi: A\\\\to B$ are unital {monomorphisms}. There exists a sequence of unitaries $\\\\{u_n\\\\}\\\\subset B$ such that $$ \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} u_n^*\\\\phi(a) u_n=\\\\psi(a)\\\\tforal a\\\\in A, $$ if and only if $$ [\\\\phi]=[\\\\psi]\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\text{in}\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, KL(A,B), \\\\phi_{\\\\sharp}=\\\\psi_{\\\\sharp}\\\\andeqn\\\\phi^{\\\\ddag}=\\\\psi^{\\\\ddag}, $$ where $\\\\phi_{\\\\sharp}, \\\\psi_{\\\\sharp}: \\\\aff(T(A))\\\\to \\\\aff(T(B))$ and $\\\\phi^{\\\\ddag}, \\\\psi^{\\\\ddag}: U(A)/CU(A)\\\\to U(B)/CU(B)$ are {the} induced maps and where $T(A)$ and $T(B)$ are tracial state spaces of $A$ and $B,$ and $CU(A)$ and $CU(B)$ are closure of {commutator} subgroups of unitary groups of $A$ and $B,$ respectively. We also show that this holds for some AH-algebras $A.$ {Moreover, if $\\\\kappa\\\\in KL(A,B)$ preserves the order and the identity, $\\\\lambda: \\\\aff(\\\\tr(A))\\\\to \\\\aff(\\\\tr(B))$ is a continuous affine map and $\\\\gamma: U(A)/CU(A)\\\\to U(B)/CU(B)$ is a \\\\hm\\\\, which are compatible, we also show that there is a unital \\\\hm\\\\, $\\\\phi: A\\\\to B$ so that $([\\\\phi],\\\\phi_{\\\\sharp},\\\\phi^{\\\\ddag})=(\\\\kappa, \\\\lambda, \\\\gamma),$ at least in the case that $K_1(A)$ is a free group, We say a digraph $G$ is a {\\\\em minor} of a digraph $H$ if $G$ can be obtained from a subdigraph of $H$ by repeatedly contracting a strongly-connected subdigraph to a vertex. Here, we show the class of all tournaments is a well-quasi-order under minor containment. In this paper we answer two questions from [16], by showing that, over any algebraically closed field, $K$, there is a finitely generated, infinitely dimensional algebra $A$ such that algebras $A\\\\otimes_{K}A$ and $A\\\\otimes_{K} A^{op}$ are nil. A method that often works for constructing a flag complex with a specified face vector is given. This method can also be adapted to construct a vertex-decomposable (and hence Cohen-Macaulay) flag complex with a specified h-vector. In this paper, we establish a local gradient estimate for a $p$-Lpalacian equation with a fast growing gradient nonlinearity. With this estimate, we can prove a parabolic Liouville theorem for ancient solutions satisfying some growth restriction near infinity. We give a systematic method for computation of Beilinson\\'s regulator map on K_1 of a fibration of curves which has a totally degenerate semistable fiber. In this paper we generalize Poletsky\\'s classical theorem to a situation where the kernel of Poisson functional is not upper semicontinuous. We give a characterization of thinness of a subset at a point in $\\\\C^n$ in term of analytic discs. A cycle base of a permutation group is defined to be a maximal set of its pairwise non-conjugate regular cyclic subgroups. It is proved that a cycle base of a permutation group of degree $n$ can be constructed in polynomial time in~$n$. Borell\\'s formula is a stochastic variational formula for the log-Laplace transform of a function of a Gaussian vector. We establish an extension of this to the Riemannian setting and give a couple of applications, including a new proof of a convolution inequality on the sphere due to Carlen, Lieb and Loss. A first order trace formula is obtained for a regular differential operator perturbed by a finite signed measure multiplication operator. We prove a fix point theorem for monoids of self-embeddings of trees. As a corollary, we obtain a result by Laflamme, Pouzet and Sauer that a tree either contains a subdivided binary tree as a subtree or has a vertex, and edge, an end or two ends fixed by all its self-embeddings. We prove a theorem, motivated by a conjecture of Voevodsky on C-systems, that provides, under some assumptions, a lift of a functor with a C-system as domain and a category as codomain, to a homomorphism of C-systems. In this paper, we consider the conormal bundle over a submanifold in a Finsler manifold and establish a volume comparison theorem. As an application, we derive a lower estimate for length of closed geodesics in a Finsler manifold. In the reversible case, a lower bound of injective radius is also obtained. We give an example of a Morita algebra $A$ with a tilting module $T$ such that the algebra $End_A(T)$ has dominant dimension at least two but is not a Morita algebra. This provides a counterexample to a conjecture by Chen and Xi from \\\\cite{CX}. We offer a simple direct proof of the unitarity of the Julia operator associated to a contraction $A$, from which follow the intertwining identity $(I - A A^*)^{1/2} A = A (I - A^* A)^{1/2}$ and the unitarity of Halmos dilations. A geometric torsion (GT) underlying a $2$-form in a $(4$$+$$1)$-dimensional $U(1)$ gauge theory is revisited with a renewed perspective for a non-perturbation (NP) gravity in $d$$=$$4$. In the context we provide evidences to a holographic correspondence between a bulk GT and a boundary NP gravity. Interestingly the Killing symmetries in General Relativity (GR) are shown to provide a subtle clue to the quantum gravity. The NP gravity is shown to incorporate a $(B_{2}$$ \\\\wedge $$F_{2})$ coupling, sourced by a non-Newtonian potential, to an exact geometry in GR. Remarkably the NP correction is identified as a mass dipole and is shown to be sourced by a propagating GT. A detailed analysis is performed in a bulk GT to show a modification to the precession of perihelion in a boundary NP gravity. The perspective of an electromagnetic (EM) wave in the bulk is investigated to reveal a spin $2$ (mass-less) quantum sourced by an apparent 2-form. A Goldstone scalar is absorbed by the apparent 2-form to describe a massive $2$-form in the coulomb gauge. Alternately a Goldstone scalar together with a local degree of GT and 2-form is argued to govern a composite (mass-less) spin $2$ particle in Lorentz gauge. Both the scenarios, further ensure a graviton in a boundary NP gravity. A qualitative analysis reveals a (non-interacting) graviton underlying a plausible gravitational wave/particle duality in NP gravity. We build a new spectrum of recursive models (SRM(T)) of a strongly minimal theory. This theory is non-disintegrated, flat, model complete, and in a language with a finite signature. We compute the Kauffman bracket polynomial of the numerator and denominator closures of A + A + ... + A ( A is repeated n times), where A is a 2-tangle shadow that has at most 4 crossings. A research for a general expression of the triplets of integer sided triangles with a $120^{\\\\circ}$ angle, in parallel with the case of a $60^{\\\\circ}$ angle. Let $D$ be a commutative domain with field of fractions $K$, let $A$ be a torsion-free $D$-algebra, and let $B$ be the extension of $A$ to a $K$-algebra. The set of integer-valued polynomials on $A$ is ${\\\\rm Int}(A) = \\\\{f \\\\in B[X] \\\\mid f(A) \\\\subseteq A\\\\}$, and the intersection of ${\\\\rm Int}(A)$ with $K[X]$ is ${\\\\rm Int}_K(A)$, which is a commutative subring of $K[X]$. The set ${\\\\rm Int}(A)$ may or may not be a ring, but it always has the structure of a left ${\\\\rm Int}_K(A)$-module. A $D$-algebra $A$ which is free as a $D$-module and of finite rank is called ${\\\\rm Int}_K$-decomposable if a $D$-module basis for $A$ is also an ${\\\\rm Int}_K(A)$-module basis for ${\\\\rm Int}(A)$; in other words, if ${\\\\rm Int}(A)$ can be generated by ${\\\\rm Int}_K(A)$ and $A$. A classification of such algebras has been given when $D$ is a Dedekind domain with finite residue rings. In the present article, we modify the definition of ${\\\\rm Int}_K$-decomposable so that it can be applied to $D$-algebras that are not necessarily free by defining $A$ to be ${\\\\rm Int}_K$-decomposable when ${\\\\rm Int}(A) \\\\cong {\\\\rm Int}_K(A) \\\\otimes_D A$. We then provide multiple characterizations of such algebras in the case where $D$ is a discrete valuation ring or a Dedekind domain with finite residue rings. In particular, if $D$ is the ring of integers of a number field $K$, we show that ${\\\\rm Int}_K$-decomposable algebras $A$ correspond to maximal $D$-orders in a separable $K$-algebra $B$, whose simple components have as center the same finite unramified Galois extension $F$ of $K$ and are unramified at each finite place of $F$. Finally, when both $D$ and $A$ are rings of integers in number fields, we show that ${\\\\rm Int}_K$-decomposable algebras correspond to unramified Galois extensions of $K$. Let A be a simple unital AT algebra of real rank zero and Inn(A) the group of inner automorphisms of A. In the previous paper we have shown that the natural map of the group of approximately inner automorphisms into Ext(K_1(A),K_0(A)) oplus Ext(K_0(A),K_1(A)) is surjective; the kernel of this map includes the subgroup of automorphisms which are homotopic to Inn(A). In this paper we consider the quotient of the group of approximately inner automorphisms by the smaller normal subgroup AInn(A) which consists of asymptotically inner automorphisms and describe it as OrderExt(K_1(A),K_0(A)) oplus Ext(K_0(A),K_1(A)), where OrderExt(K_1(A),K_0(A)) is a kind of extension group which takes into account the fact that K_0(A) is an ordered group and has the usual Ext as a quotient. We obtain a vanishing theorem for the kernel of a Dirac operator on a Clifford module twisted by a sufficiently large power of a line bundle, whose curvature is non-degenerate at any point of the base manifold. In particular, if the base manifold is almost complex, we prove a vanishing theorem for the kernel of a $\\\\spin^c$ Dirac operator twisted by a line bundle with curvature of a mixed sign. In this case we also relax the assumption of non-degeneracy of the curvature. These results are generalization of a vanishing theorem of Borthwick and Uribe. As an application we obtain a new proof of the classical Andreotti-Grauert vanishing theorem for the cohomology of a compact complex manifold with values in the sheaf of holomorphic sections of a holomorphic vector bundle, twisted by a large power of a holomorphic line bundle with curvature of a mixed sign. As another application we calculate the sign of the index of a signature operator twisted by a large power of a line bundle. Let A be a finite dimensional Hopf algebra and (H, R) a quasitriangular bialgebra. Denote by H^*_R a certain deformation of the multiplication of H^* via R. We prove that H^*_R is a quantum commutative left H\\\\otimes H^{op cop}-module algebra. If H is the Drinfel\\'d double of A then H^*_R is the Heisenberg double of A. We study the relation between H^*_R and Majid\\'s \"covariantised product\". We give a formula for the canonical element of the Heisenberg double of A, solution to the pentagon equation, in terms of the R-matrix of the Drinfel\\'d double of A. We generalize a theorem of Jiang-Hua Lu on quantum groupoids and using this and the above we obtain an example of a quantum groupoid having the Heisenberg double of A as base. If, in Richard Borcherds\\' concept of a \"vertex group\" we allow the \"ring of singular functions\" to be noncommutative, we prove that if A is a finite dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebra then the Heisenberg double of A is a vertex group over A. The construction and properties of H^*_R are given also for quasi-bialgebras and a definition for the Heisenberg double of a finite dimensional quasi-Hopf algebra is proposed. We study the extent to which sets A in Z/NZ, N prime, resemble sets of integers from the additive point of view (``up to Freiman isomorphism\\'\\'). We give a direct proof of a result of Freiman, namely that if |A + A| < K|A| and |A| < c(K)N then A is Freiman isomorphic to a set of integers. Because we avoid appealing to Freiman\\'s structure theorem, we get a reasonable bound: we can take c(K) > exp(-cK^2 log K). As a byproduct of our argument we obtain a sharpening of the second author\\'s result on sets with small sumset in torsion groups. For example if A is a subset of F_2^n, and if |A + A| < K|A|, then A is contained in a coset of a subspace of size no more than 2^{CK^2}|A|. For a tuple $A=(A_0, A_1, ..., A_n)$ of elements in a unital Banach algebra ${\\\\mathcal B}$, its {\\\\em projective spectrum} $p(A)$ is defined to be the collection of $z=[z_0, z_1, ..., z_n]\\\\in \\\\pn$ such that $A(z)=z_0A_0+z_1A_1+... +z_nA_n$ is not invertible in ${\\\\mathcal B}$. The pre-image of $p(A)$ in ${\\\\cc}^{n+1}$ is denoted by $P(A)$. When ${\\\\mathcal B}$ is the $k\\\\times k$ matrix algebra $M_k(\\\\cc)$, the projective spectrum is a projective hypersurface. In infinite dimensional cases, projective spectrums can be very complicated, but also have some properties similar to that of hypersurfaces. When $A$ is commutative, $P(A)$ is a union of hyperplanes. When ${\\\\mathcal B}$ is reflexive or is a $C^*$-algebra, the {\\\\em projective resolvent set} $P^c(A):=\\\\cc^{n+1}\\\\setminus P(A)$ is shown to be a disjoint union of domains of holomorphy. Later part of this paper studies Maurer-Cartan type ${\\\\mathcal B}$-valued 1-form $A^{-1}(z)dA(z)$ on $P^c(A)$. As a consequence, we show that if ${\\\\mathcal B}$ is a $C^*$-algebra with a trace $\\\\phi$, then $\\\\phi(A^{-1}(z)dA(z))$ is a nontrivial element in the de Rham cohomology space $H^1_d(P^c(A), \\\\cc)$. The notion of a bimodule herd is introduced and studied. A bimodule herd consists of a $B$-$A$ bimodule, its formal dual, called a pen, and a map, called a shepherd, which satisfies untiality and coassociativity conditions. It is shown that every bimodule herd gives rise to a pair of corings and coactions. If, in addition, a bimodule herd is tame i.e. it is faithfully flat and a progenerator, then these corings are associated to entwining structures; the bimodule herd is a Galois comodule of these corings. The notion of a bicomodule coherd is introduced as a formal dualisation of the definition of a bimodule herd. Every bicomodule coherd defines a pair of (non-unital) rings. It is shown that a tame $B$-$A$ bimodule herd defines a bicomodule coherd, and sufficient conditions for the derived rings to be isomorphic to $A$ and $B$ are discussed. The composition of bimodule herds via the tensor product is outlined. The notion of a bimodule herd is illustrated by the example of Galois co-objects of a commutative, faithfully flat Hopf algebra. We define new parameters, a zero interval and a dual zero interval, of subsets in $P$- or $Q$-polynomial schemes. A zero interval of a subset in a $P$-polynomial scheme is a successive interval index for which the inner distribution vanishes, and a dual zero interval of a subset in a $Q$-polynomial scheme is a successive interval index for which the dual inner distribution vanishes. We derive the bounds of the lengths of a zero interval and a dual zero interval using the degree and dual degree respectively, and show that a subset in a $P$-polynomial scheme (resp. a $Q$-polynomial scheme) having a large length of a zero interval (resp. a dual zero interval) induces a completely regular code (resp. a $Q$-polynomial scheme). Moreover, we consider the spherical analogue of a dual zero interval. Well known connections exist between the singular value decomposition of a matrix A and the Schur decomposition of its symmetric embedding sym(A) = [ 0 A; A\\' 0]. In particular, if s is a singular value of A then +s and -s are eigenvalues of the symmetric embedding. The top and bottom halves of sym(A)\\'s eigenvectors are singular vectors for A. Power methods applied to A can be related to power methods applied to sym(A). The rank of sym(A) is twice the rank of A. In this paper we show how to embed a general order-d tensor A into an order-d symmetric tensor sym(A). Through the embedding we relate (a) power methods for A\\'s singular values to power methods for sym(A)\\'s eigenvalues and (b) the rank of A to the rank of sym(A). A (d-parameter) basic nilsequence is a sequence of the form \\\\psi(n)=f(a^{n}x), n \\\\in Z^{d}, where x is a point of a compact nilmanifold X, a is a translation on X, and f is a continuous function on X; a nilsequence is a uniform limit of basic nilsequences. If X is a compact nilmanifold, Y is a subnilmanifold of X, g(n) is a (d-parameter) polynomial sequence of translations of X, and f is a continuous function on X, we show that the sequence \\\\int_{g(n)Y}f is the sum of a basic nilsequence and a sequence that converges to zero in uniform density (a null-sequence). We also show that an integral of a family of nilsequences is a nilsequence plus a null-sequence. We deduce that for any invertible finite measure preserving system (W,\\\\mu,T), integer polynomials p_{1},...,p_{k} on Z^{d}, and measurable sets A_{1},...,A_{k} in W, the sequence \\\\mu(T^{p_{1}(n)}A_{1}\\\\cap...\\\\cap T^{p_{k}(n)}A_{k}), n\\\\in Z^{d}, is the sum of a nilsequence and a null-sequence. Assume that A is a unital separable simple C*-algebra with real rank zero, stable rank one, strict comparison of projections, and that its tracial simplex T(A) has a finite number of extremal points. We prove that every self-adjoint element a in A in the kernel of all tracial states is the sum of two commutators in A and that every positive element of A is a linear combination of projections with positive coefficients. Assume that A is as above but \\\\sigma-unital. Then an element (resp. a positive element) a of A is a linear combination (resp. a linear combination with positive coefficients) of projections if and only if for all \\\\tau in T(A), the extension \\\\bar\\\\tau to the enveloping von Neumann algebra has a finite value for the range projection of a. Assume that A is unital and as above but T(A) has infinitely many extremal points. Then A is not the linear span of its projections. This result settles two open problems of Marcoux. We give a complete characterization of nonnegative integers $j$ and $k$ and a positive integer $n$ for which there is an $n$-by-$n$ matrix with its power partial isometry index equal to $j$ and its ascent equal to $k$. Recall that the power partial isometry index $p(A)$ of a matrix $A$ is the supremum, possibly infinity, of nonnegative integers $j$ such that $I, A, A^2, \\\\ldots, A^j$ are all partial isometries while the ascent $a(A)$ of $A$ is the smallest integer $k\\\\ge 0$ for which $\\\\ker A^k$ equals $\\\\ker A^{k+1}$. It was known before that, for any matrix $A$, either $p(A)\\\\le\\\\min\\\\{a(A), n-1\\\\}$ or $p(A)=\\\\infty$. In this paper, we prove more precisely that there is an $n$-by-$n$ matrix $A$ such that $p(A)=j$ and $a(A)=k$ if and only if one of the following conditions holds: (a) $j=k\\\\le n-1$, (b) $j\\\\le k-1$ and $j+k\\\\le n-1$, and (c) $j\\\\le k-2$ and $j+k=n$. This answers a question we asked in a previous paper. We present an approach for the traveling salesman problem with graph metric based on Steiner cycles. A Steiner cycle is a cycle that is required to contain some specified subset of vertices. For a graph $G$, if we can find a spanning tree $T$ and a simple cycle that contains the vertices with odd-degree in $T$, then we show how to combine the classic \"double spanning tree\" algorithm with Christofides\\' algorithm to obtain a TSP tour of length at most $\\\\frac{4n}{3}$. We use this approach to show that a graph containing a Hamiltonian path has a TSP tour of length at most $4n/3$. Since a Hamiltonian path is a spanning tree with two leaves, this motivates the question of whether or not a graph containing a spanning tree with few leaves has a short TSP tour. The recent techniques of M\\\\\"omke and Svensson imply that a graph containing a depth-first-search tree with $k$ leaves has a TSP tour of length $4n/3 + O(k)$. Using our approach, we can show that a $2(k-1)$-vertex connected graph that contains a spanning tree with at most $k$ leaves has a TSP tour of length $4n/3$. We also explore other conditions under which our approach results in a short tour. It has been conjectured by Sarkozy that with finitely many exceptions, the set of quadratic residues modulo a prime $p$ cannot be represented as a sumset $\\\\{a+b\\\\colon a\\\\in A, b\\\\in B\\\\}$ with non-singleton sets $A,B\\\\subset F_p$. The case $A=B$ of this conjecture has been recently established by Shkredov. The analogous problem for differences remains open: is it true that for all sufficiently large primes $p$, the set of quadratic residues modulo $p$ is not of the form $\\\\{a\\'-a\"\\\\colon a\\',a\"\\\\in A,\\\\,a\\'\\\\ne a\"\\\\}$ with $A\\\\subset F_p$? We attack here a presumably more tractable variant of this problem, which is to show that there is no $A\\\\subset F_p$ such that every quadratic residue has a \\\\emph{unique}representation as $a\\'-a\"$ with $a\\',a\"\\\\in A$, and no non-residue is represented in this form. We give a number of necessary conditions for the existence of such $A$, involving for the most part the behavior of primes dividing $p-1$. These conditions enable us to rule out all primes $p$ in the range $13<p<10^{18}$ (the primes $p=5$ and $p=13$ being conjecturally the only exceptions). A pizza is a pair of planar convex bodies $A\\\\subseteq B$,where $B$ represents the dough and $A$ the topping of the pizza. A partition of a pizza by straight lines is a succession of double operations:a cut by a full straight line, followed by a Euclidean move of one of theresulting pieces; then the procedure is repeated.The final partition is said to be fair if each resulting slice has the same amount of $A$ and the same amount of $B$.This note proves that, given an integer $n\\\\geq2$, there exists a fair partition by straight lines of any pizza $(A,B)$ into $n$ parts if and onlyif $n$ is even.The proof uses the following result:For any planar convex bodies $A, B$ with $A\\\\subseteq B$, and any$\\\\alpha\\\\in\\\\,]0,\\\\frac12[\\\\,$, there exists an $\\\\alpha$-section of $A$ which is a$\\\\beta$-section of $B$ for some $\\\\beta\\\\geq\\\\alpha$. (An $\\\\alpha$-section of $A$ is a straight line cutting $A$ into two parts, one of which has area $\\\\alpha|A|$.)The question remains open if the word \"planar\" is dropped. Let A be a comodule algebra for a finite dimensional Hopf algebra K over an algebraically closed field k, and let A^K be the subalgebra of invariants. Let Z be a central subalgebra in A, which is a domain with quotient field Q. Assume that Q\\\\otimes_Z A is a central simple algebra over Q, and either A is a finitely generated torsion-free Z-module and Z is integrally closed in Q, or A is a finite projective Z-module. Then we show that A and Z are integral over the subring of central invariants Z\\\\cap A^K. More generally, we show that this statement is valid under the same assumptions if Z is a reduced algebra with quotient ring Q, and Q\\\\otimes_Z A is a semisimple algebra with center Q. In particular, the statement holds for a coaction of K on a prime PI algebra A whose center Z is an integrally closed finitely generated domain over k. This generalizes the results of S. Skryabin in the case when A is commutative. For the proof, we develop a theory of Galois bimodules over semisimple algebras finite over the center. The paper deals with a certain class of random evolutions. We develop a construction that yields an invariant measure for a continuous-time Markov process with random transitions. The approach is based on a particular way of constructing the combined process, where the generator is defined as a sum of two terms: one responsible for the evolution of the environment and the second representing generators of processes with a given state of environment. (The two operators are not assumed to commute.) The presentation includes fragments of a general theory and pays a particular attention to several types of examples: (1) a queueing system with a random change of parameters (including a Jackson network and, as a special case: a single-server queue with a diffusive behavior of arrival and service rates), (2) a simple-exclusion model in presence of a special `heavy` particle, (3) a diffusion with drift-switching, and (4) a diffusion with a randomly diffusion-type varying diffusion coefficient (including a modification of the Heston random volatility model). For any group $G$ and set $A$, a cellular automaton over $G$ and $A$ is a transformation $\\\\tau : A^G \\\\to A^G$ defined via a finite neighborhood $S \\\\subseteq G$ (called a memory set of $\\\\tau$) and a local function $\\\\mu : A^S \\\\to A$. In this paper, we assume that $G$ and $A$ are both finite and study various algebraic properties of the finite monoid $\\\\text{CA}(G,A)$ consisting of all cellular automata over $G$ and $A$. Let $\\\\text{ICA}(G;A)$ be the group of invertible cellular automata over $G$ and $A$. In the first part, using information on the conjugacy classes of subgroups of $G$, we give a detailed description of the structure of $\\\\text{ICA}(G;A)$ in terms of direct and wreath products. In the second part, we study generating sets of $\\\\text{CA}(G;A)$. In particular, we prove that $\\\\text{CA}(G,A)$ cannot be generated by cellular automata with small memory set, and, when $G$ is finite abelian, we determine the minimal size of a set $V \\\\subseteq \\\\text{CA}(G;A)$ such that $\\\\text{CA}(G;A) = \\\\langle \\\\text{ICA}(G;A) \\\\cup V \\\\rangle$. In this paper, we consider the sum-product problem of obtaining lower bounds for the size of the set $$\\\\frac{A+A}{A+A}:=\\\\left \\\\{ \\\\frac{a+b}{c+d} : a,b,c,d \\\\in A, c+d \\\\neq 0 \\\\right\\\\},$$ for an arbitrary finite set $A$ of real numbers. The main result is the bound $$\\\\left| \\\\frac{A+A}{A+A} \\\\right| \\\\gg \\\\frac{|A|^{2+\\\\frac{2}{25}}}{|A:A|^{\\\\frac{1}{25}}\\\\log |A|},$$ where $A:A$ denotes the ratio set of $A$. This improves on a result of Balog and the author (arXiv:1402.5775), provided that the size of the ratio set is subquadratic in $|A|$. That is, we establish that the inequality $$\\\\left| \\\\frac{A+A}{A+A} \\\\right| \\\\ll |A|^{2} \\\\Rightarrow |A:A| \\\\gg \\\\frac{ |A|^2}{\\\\log^{25}|A|} . $$ This extremal result answers a question similar to some conjectures in a recent paper of the author and Zhelezov (arXiv:1410.1156). In this paper, we introduce and study the notion of cointegrals in a weak multiplier Hopf algebras $(A, \\\\Delta)$. A cointegral is a non-zero element $h$ in the multiplier algebra $M(A)$ such that $ah=\\\\v_t(a)h$ for any $a\\\\in A$. When $A$ has a faithful set of cointegrals (now we call $A$ of {\\\\it discrete type}), we give a sufficient and necessary condition for existence of integrals on $A$. Then we consider a special case, i.e., $A$ has a single faithful cointegral, and we obtain more better results, such as $A$ is Frobenius, quasi-Frobenius, et al. Moreover when an algebraic quantum groupoid $A$ has a faithful cointegral, then the dual $\\\\widehat{A}$ must be weak Hopf algebra. In the end, we investigate when $A$ has a cointegral and study relation between compact and discrete type. In this paper we characterize the maximal modular ideals of an evolution algebra $A\\\\,\\\\ $in order to describe its Jacobson radical, \\\\ $Rad(A).$ We characterize semisimple evolution algebras (i.e. those such that $% Rad(A)=\\\\{0\\\\}$)as well as radical ones. We introduce two elemental notions of spectrum of an element $a$ in an evolution algebra $A$, namely the spectrum $% \\\\sigma ^{A}(a)$ and the m-spectrum $\\\\sigma _{m}^{A}(a)$ (they coincide for associative algebras, but in general $\\\\sigma ^{A}(a)\\\\subseteq \\\\sigma _{m}^{A}(a),$ and we show examples where the inclusion is strict). We prove that they are non-empty and describe $\\\\sigma ^{A}(a)$ and $\\\\sigma _{m}^{A}(a) $ in terms of the eigenvalues of a suitable matrix related with the structure constants matrix of $A.$ We say $A$ is m-semisimple (respectively spectrally semisimple) if zero is the unique \\\\ ideal contained into the set of $a$ in $A$ such that $\\\\sigma _{m}^{A}(a)=\\\\{0\\\\}$ $\\\\ $(respectively $\\\\sigma ^{A}(a)=\\\\{0\\\\}$). In contrast to the associative case (where the notions of semisimplicity, spectrally semisimplicty and m-semisimplicity are equivalent)\\\\ we show examples of m-semisimple evolution algebras $A$ that, nevertheless, are radical algebras (i.e. $Rad(A)=A$). Also some theorems about automatic continuity of homomorphisms will be considered. The Witt ring $W(K)$ of a field is a central object in the algebraic theory of quadratic forms. In general, we can define a Witt ring for commutative rings with involution. But if $(A,\\\\sigma)$ is a central simple algebra with involution of the first over a field $K$, we only have Witt groups $W^\\\\varepsilon(A,\\\\sigma)$, mainly because $A$ is not commutative, so there is no appropriate tensor product of modules. We use the fact that there is a hermitian Morita equivalence between $(A\\\\otimes_K A,\\\\sigma\\\\otimes \\\\sigma)$ and $(K,Id)$ to define a commutative graded ring structure on $\\\\widetilde{W}(A,\\\\sigma) = W(K) \\\\oplus W^+(A,\\\\sigma)\\\\oplus W^-(A,\\\\sigma)$, the main difficulty being the associativity. We study the basic properties of this ring (the mixed Witt ring of $(A,\\\\sigma)$), as well as the mixed Grothendieck-Witt ring $\\\\widetilde{GW}(A,\\\\sigma)$. In particular, $\\\\widetilde{GW}(A,\\\\sigma)$ is a pre-$\\\\lambda$-ring for some exterior power operations defined through hermitian Morita equivalences. The mixed Witt ring has a fundamental filtration, and the associated graded ring has strong links with modulo 2 Galois cohomology. We also classify the prime ideals of $\\\\widetilde{W}(A,\\\\sigma)$ and relate this to the previous studies on signatures for hermitian forms. Let $A$ be an algebra and let $f$ be a noncommutative polynomial. In the first part of the paper, we consider the relationship between $[A,A]$, the linear span of commutators in $A$, and span$\\\\,f(A)$, the linear span of the image of $f$ in $A$. In particular, we show that, under mild assumptions, $[A,A]=A$ implies span\\\\,$f(A)=A$. In the second part, we establish some Waring type results for images of polynomials. For example, we show that if $C$ is a commutative unital algebra over a field $F$ of characteristic $0$, $A$ is the matrix algebra $M_n(C)$, and the polynomial $f$ is neither an identity nor a central polynomial of $M_n(F)$, then every commutator in $A$ can be written as a difference of two elements, each of which is a sum of $7788$ elements from $f(A)$ (if $C=F$ is an algebraically closed field, then $4$ elements suffice). Similar results are obtained for some other algebras, in particular for the algebra $B(H)$ of all bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space $H$. We study the decay rate $\\\\theta(a)$ that chracterizes the late time exponential decay of the first-passage probability density, $F_a(t|0) \\\\sim e^{-\\\\theta(a)\\\\, t}$, of a diffusing particle in a one dimensional confining potential $U(x)$, starting from the origin, to a position located at $a>0$. For general confining potential $U(x)$ we show that $\\\\theta(a)$, a measure of the barrier (located at $a$) crossing rate, has three distinct behaviors as a function of $a$, depending on the tail of $U(x)$ as $x\\\\to -\\\\infty$. In particular, for potentials behaving as $U(x)\\\\sim |x|$ when $x\\\\to -\\\\infty$, we show that a novel freezing transition occurs at a critical value $a=a_c$, i.e, $\\\\theta(a)$ increases monotonically as $a$ decreases till $a_c$, and for $a \\\\le a_c$ it freezes to $\\\\theta (a)=\\\\theta(a_c)$. Our results are established using a general mapping to a quantum problem and by exact solution in three representative cases, supported by numerical simulations. We show that the freezing transition occurs when in the associated quantum problem, the gap between the ground state (bound) and the continuum of scattering states vanishes. A weak multiplier Hopf algebra is a pair (A,\\\\Delta) of a non-degenerate idempotent algebra A and a coproduct $\\\\Delta$ on A. The coproduct is a coassociative homomorphism from A to the multiplier algebra M(A\\\\otimes A) with some natural extra properties (like the existence of a counit). Further we impose extra but natural conditions on the ranges and the kernels of the canonical maps T_1 and T_2 defined from A\\\\otimes A to M(A\\\\otimes A) by T_1(a\\\\otimes b)=\\\\Delta(a)(1\\\\otimes b) and T_2(a\\\\ot b)=(a\\\\otimes 1)\\\\Delta(b). The first condition is about the ranges of these maps. It is assumed that there exists an idempotent element E\\\\in M(A\\\\otimes A) such that \\\\Delta(A)(1\\\\ot A)=E(A\\\\ot A) and (A\\\\otimes 1)\\\\Delta(A)=(A\\\\otimes A)E. The second condition determines the behavior of the coproduct on the legs of E. We require (\\\\Delta\\\\otimes \\\\iota)(E)=(\\\\iota\\\\otimes\\\\Delta)(E)=(1\\\\otimes E)(E\\\\ot 1)=(E\\\\otimes 1)(1\\\\otimes E) where $\\\\iota$ is the identity map and where $\\\\Delta\\\\otimes \\\\iota$ and $\\\\iota\\\\otimes\\\\Delta$ are extensions to the multipier algebra M(A\\\\otimes A). Finally, the last condition determines the kernels of the canonical maps T_1 and T_2 in terms of this idempotent E by a very specific relation. From these conditions we develop the theory. In particular, we construct a unique antipode satisfying the expected properties and various other data. Special attention is given to the regular case (that is when the antipode is bijective) and the case of a *-algebra (where regularity is automatic). Weak Hopf algebras are special cases of such weak multiplier Hopf algebras. Conversely, if the underlying algebra of a (regular) weak multiplier Hopf algebra has an identity, it is a weak Hopf algebra. Also any groupoid, finite or not, yields two weak multiplier Hopf algebras in duality. We report the discovery of eight hot-Jupiter exoplanets from the WASP-South transit survey. WASP-144b has a mass of 0.44 Mj, a radius of 0.85 Rj, and is in a 2.27-d orbit around a V = 12.9, K2 star which shows a 21-d rotational modulation. WASP-145Ab is a 0.89 Mj planet in a 1.77-d orbit with a grazing transit, which means that the planetary radius is not well constrained. The host is a V = 11.5, K2 star with a companion 5 arcsecs away and 1.4 mags fainter. WASP-158b is a relatively massive planet at 2.8 Mj with a radius of 1.1 Rj and a 3.66-d orbit. It transits a V = 12.1, F6 star. WASP-159b is a bloated hot Jupiter (1.4 Rj and 0.55 Mj) in a 3.8-d orbit around a V = 12.9, F9 star. WASP-162b is a massive planet in a relatively long and highly eccentric orbit (5.2 Mj, P = 9.6 d, e = 0.43). It transits a V = 12.2, K0 star. WASP-168b is a bloated hot Jupiter (0.42 Mj, 1.5 Rj) in a 4.15-d orbit with a grazing transit. The host is a V = 12.1, F9 star. WASP-172b is a bloated hot Jupiter (0.5 Mj; 1.6 Rj) in a 5.48-d orbit around a V = 11.0, F1 star. It is likely to be the best planet of those reported here for atmospheric characterisation. WASP-173Ab is a massive planet (3.7 Mj) with a 1.2 Rj radius in a circular orbit with a period of 1.39 d. The host is a V = 11.3, G3 star, being the brighter component of the double-star system WDS23366-3437, with a companion 6 arcsecs away and 0.8 mags fainter. One of the two stars shows a rotational modulation of 7.9 d. The local multiplier C*-algebra M_{loc}(A) of any C*-algebra A can *-isomorphicly embedded into the injective envelope I(A) of A in such a way that the canonical embeddings of A into both these C*-algebras are identified. If A is commutative then M_{loc}(A) = I(A) . The injective envelopes of A and M_{loc}(A) always coincide, and every higher order local multiplier C*-algebra of A is contained in the regular monotone completion \\\\bar{A} in I(A) of A . In case the set Z(A).A is dense in A the center of the local multiplier C*-algebra of A is the local multiplier C*-algebra of the center of A, and both they are *-isomorphic to the injective envelope of the center of A . A Wittstock type extension theorem for completely bounded bimodule maps on operator bimodules taking values in M_{loc}(A) is proven to hold if and only if M_{loc}(A) = I(A). In general, a solution of the problem for which C*-algebras A the C*-algebras M_{loc}(A) is injective is shown to be equivalent to the solution of I. Kaplansky\\'s 1951 problem whether all AW*-algebras are monotone complete. A system (P_a: a in A) of probability measures on a common state space S indexed by another index set A can be ``realized\\'\\' by a system (X_a: a in A) of S-valued random variables on some probability space in such a way that each X_a is distributed as P_a. Assuming that A and S are both partially ordered, we may ask when the system (P_a: a in A) can be realized by a system (X_a: a in A) with the monotonicity property that X_a <= X_b almost surely whenever a <= b. When such a realization is possible, we call the system (P_a: a in A) ``realizably monotone.\\'\\' Such a system necessarily is stochastically monotone, that is, satisfies P_a <= P_b in stochastic ordering whenever a <= b. In general, stochastic monotonicity is not sufficient for realizable monotonicity. However, for some particular choices of partial orderings in a finite state setting, these two notions of monotonicity are equivalent. We develop an inverse probability transform for a certain broad class of posets S, and use it to explicitly construct a system (X_a: a in A) realizing the monotonicity of a stochastically monotone system when the two notions of monotonicity are equivalent. Let N be the set all of non-negative integers, let A be a finite subset of N, and let (2A) be the set of all numbers of form a+b for each a and b in A. The arithmetic structure of A was accurately characterized by Freiman when (i) |2A|<3|A|-3, (ii) |2A|=3|A|-3, or (iii) |2A|=3|A|-2. It is also suggested by Freiman that for characterizing the arithmetic structure of A when |2A|>3|A|-2, analytic methods need to be used. However, the interesting and more general results of Freiman, which use analytic methods, no longer give the arithmetic structure of A as precise as the results mentioned above. In this paper we characterize, with the help of nonstandard analysis, the arithmetic structure of A along the same lines as Freiman\\'s results mentioned above when |2A|=3|A|-3+b where b is positive but not too large. Precisely, we prove that there is a positive real number epsilon and a natural number K such that if |A|>K and |2A|=3|A|-3+b for b between 0 and epsilon times |A|, then A is either a subset of an arithmetic progression of length at most 2|A|-1+2b or a subset of a bi-arithmetic progression of length at most |A|+b. The union of two arithmetic progressions I and J of the same difference d is called a bi-arithmetic progression if I+I, I+J, and J+J are pairwise disjoint. We introduce a new formalism of differential operators for a general associative algebra A. It replaces Grothendieck\\'s notion of differential operator on a commutative algebra in such a way that derivations of the commutative algebra are replaced by DDer(A), the bimodule of double derivations. Our differential operators act not on the algebra A itself but rather on F(A), a certain `Fock space\\' associated to any noncommutative algebra A in a functorial way. The corresponding algebra D(F(A)), of differential operators, is filtered and gr D(F(A)), the associated graded algebra, is commutative in some `twisted\\' sense. The resulting double Poisson structure on gr D(F(A)) is closely related to the one introduced by Van den Bergh. Specifically, we prove that gr D(F(A))=F(T_A(DDer(A)), provided A is smooth. It is crucial for our construction that the Fock space F(A) carries an extra-structure of a wheelgebra, a new notion closely related to the notion of a wheeled PROP. There are also notions of Lie wheelgebras, and so on. In that language, D(F(A)) becomes the universal enveloping wheelgebra of a Lie wheelgebroid of double derivations. In the second part of the paper we show, extending a classical construction of Koszul to the noncommutative setting, that any Ricci-flat, torsion-free bimodule connection on DDer(A) gives rise to a second order (wheeled) differential operator, a noncommutative analogue of the BV-operator. Given an automaton (a letter-to-letter transducer, a dynamical 1-Lipschitz system on the space $\\\\mathbb Z_p$ of $p$-adic integers) $\\\\mathfrak A$ whose input and output alphabets are $\\\\mathbb F_p=\\\\{0,1,\\\\ldots,p-1\\\\}$, one visualizes word transformations performed by $\\\\mathfrak A$ by a point set $\\\\mathbf P(\\\\mathfrak A)$ in real plane $\\\\mathbb R^2$. For a finite-state automaton $\\\\mathfrak A$, it is shown that once some points of $\\\\mathbf P(\\\\mathfrak A)$ constitute a smooth (of a class $C^2$) curve in $\\\\mathbb R^2$, the curve is a segment of a straight line with a rational slope; and there are only finitely many straight lines whose segments are in $\\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathfrak A)$. Moreover, when identifying $\\\\mathbf P(\\\\mathfrak A)$ with a subset of a 2-dimensional torus $\\\\mathbb T^2\\\\subset\\\\mathbb R^3$ (under a natural mapping of the real unit square $[0,1]^2$ onto $\\\\mathbb T^2$) the smooth curves from $\\\\mathbf P(\\\\mathfrak A)$ constitute a collection of torus windings. In cylindrical coordinates either of the windings can be ascribed to a complex-valued function $\\\\psi(x)=e^{i(Ax-2\\\\pi B(t))}$ $(x\\\\in\\\\mathbb R)$ for suitable rational $A,B(t)$. Since $\\\\psi(x)$ is a standard expression for a matter wave in quantum theory (where $B(t)=tB(t_0)$), and since transducers can be regarded as a mathematical formalization for causal discrete systems, the paper might serve as a mathematical reasoning why wave phenomena are inherent in quantum systems: This is because of causality principle and the discreteness of matter. Exact bounds are obtained for the quenched free energy of a polymer with random hydrophobicities in the presence of an interface separating a polar from a non polar solvent. The polymer may be ideal or have steric self-interactions. The bounds allow to prove that a ``neutral\\'\\' random polymer is localized near the interface at any temperature, whereas a ``non-neutral\\'\\' chain is shown to undergo a delocalization transition at a finite temperature. These results are valid for a quite general a priori probability distribution for both independent and correlated hydrophobic charges. As a particular case we consider random AB-copolymers and confirm recent numerical studies. We investigate how a dynamical mass of a fermion is affected by a topological mass of a gauge field in a Maxwell-Chern-Simons $QED_3$ coupled with a two-component fermion. The dynamical mass and also a parity condensate are estimated by using a non-perturbative Schwinger-Dyson method. In particular, we study a limit of vanishing the topological mass in detail and clarify a linking between theories with and without a Chern-Simons term in a non-perturbative level. Let $A$ be a von Neumann algebra with no direct summand of Type $\\\\roman I_2$, and let $\\\\scr P(A)$ be its lattice of projections. Let $X$ be a Banach space. Let $m\\\\:\\\\scr P(A)\\\\to X$ be a bounded function such that $m(p+q)=m(p)+m(q)$ whenever $p$ and $q$ are orthogonal projections. The main theorem states that $m$ has a unique extension to a bounded linear operator from $A$ to $X$. In particular, each bounded complex-valued finitely additive quantum measure on $\\\\scr P(A)$ has a unique extension to a bounded linear functional on $A$. For a cardinal mu we give a sufficient condition (*)_mu (involving ranks measuring existence of independent sets) for: [(**)_mu] if a Borel set B subseteq R x R contains a mu-square (i.e. a set of the form A x A, |A|= mu) then it contains a 2^{aleph_0}-square and even a perfect square, and also for [(***)_mu] if psi in L_{omega_1, omega} has a model of cardinality mu then it has a model of cardinality continuum generated in a nice, absolute way. Assuming MA + 2^{aleph_0}> mu for transparency, those three conditions ((*)_mu, (**)_mu and (***)_mu) are equivalent, and by this we get e.g.: for all alpha<omega_1: 2^{aleph_0} >= aleph_alpha => not (**)_{aleph_alpha}, and also min {mu :(*)_mu}, if <2^{aleph_0}, has cofinality aleph_1. We deal also with Borel rectangles and related model theoretic problems. We define a general notion of abstract double Lie algebroid. We show (1) that the double Lie algebroid of a double Lie groupoid is a double Lie algebroid in this sense; (2) that the double cotangent constructed from Lie algebroid structures on a vector bundle A and its dual A* is a double Lie algebroid if and only if (A, A*) is a Lie bialgebroid; (3) that a vacant double Lie algebroid structure is equivalent to a matched pair structure on the side Lie algebroids. We obtain several results and examples concerning the general question ``When must a space with a small diagonal have a G_delta-diagonal?\". In particular, we show (1) every compact metrizably fibered space with a small diagonal is metrizable; (2) there are consistent examples of regular Lindelof (even hereditarily Lindelof) spaces with a small diagonal but no G_delta-diagonal; (3) every first-countable hereditarily Lindelof space with a small diagonal has a G_delta-diagonal; (4) assuming CH, every Lindelof Sigma-space with a small diagonal has a countable network; (5) whether countably compact spaces with a small diagonal are metrizable depends on your set theory; (6) there is a locally compact space with a small diagonal but no G_delta diagonal. The notion of a generalized Lie bialgebroid (a generalization of the notion of a Lie bialgebroid) is introduced in such a way that a Jacobi manifold has associated a canonical generalized Lie bialgebroid. As a kind of converse, we prove that a Jacobi structure can be defined on the base space of a generalized Lie bialgebroid. We also show that it is possible to construct a Lie bialgebroid from a generalized Lie bialgebroid and, as a consequence, we deduce a duality theorem. Finally, some special classes of generalized Lie bialgebroids are considered: triangular generalized Lie bialgebroids and generalized Lie bialgebras. The Bass-Heller-Swan-Farrell-Hsiang-Siebenmann decomposition of the Whitehead group $K_1(A_{\\\\rho}[z,z^{-1}])$ of a twisted Laurent polynomial extension $A_{\\\\rho}[z,z^{-1}]$ of a ring $A$ is generalized to a decomposition of the Whitehead group $K_1(A_{\\\\rho}((z)))$ of a twisted Novikov ring of power series $A_{\\\\rho}((z))=A_{\\\\rho}[[z]][z^{-1}]$. The decomposition involves a summand $W_1(A,\\\\rho)$ which is an abelian quotient of the multiplicative group $W(A,\\\\rho)$ of Witt vectors $1+a_1z+a_2z^2+... \\\\in A_{\\\\rho}[[z]]$. An example is constructed to show that in general the natural surjection $W(A,\\\\rho)^{ab} \\\\to W_1(A,\\\\rho)$ is not an isomorphism. In this paper we identify QD(A,B), the quasidiagonal classes in KK_1(A,B), in terms of K_*(A) and K_*(B), and we use these results in various applications. Here is our central result. Theorem: Suppose that A is in the category of separable nuclear C^*-algebras which satisfy the UCT and A is quasidiagonal relative to B. Then there is a natural isomorphism QD(A,B) = Pext (K_*(A), K_*(B))_0 . Thus quasidiagonality of KK-classes is indeed a topological invariant. We give several applications. Finally, we establish a converse to a theorem of Davidson, Herrero, and Salinas, giving conditions under which the quasidiagonality of A/K implies the quasidiagonality of the associated representation of A. In the present paper we continue the study of the structure of a Banach algebra B(A, T_g) generated by a certain Banach algebra $A$ of operators acting in a Banach space $D$ and a group {T_g}_{g \\\\in G} of isometries of D such that T_g A T^{-1}_g = A. We investigate the interrelations between the existence of the expectation of B(A, T_g) onto $A$, metrical freedom of the automorphisms of A induced by T_g and the dual action of the group G on B(A, T_g). The results obtained are applied to the description of the structure of Banach algebras generated by \\'weighted composition operators\\' acting in Lebesgue spaces. In the present paper we study the structure of a Banach algebra B(A, T_g) generated by a certain Banach algebra $A$ of operators acting in a Banach space D and a group {T_g}_{g \\\\in G} of isometries of D such that T_g A T^{-1}_g = A. We investigate the interrelations between the existence of the expectation of B(A, T_g) onto A, topological freedom of the automorphisms of A induced by T_g and the dual action of the group G on B(A, T_g). The results obtained are applied to the description of the structure of Banach algebras generated by \\'weighted composition operators\\' acting in various spaces. Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A means a weak structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B contained in A which is embedded with a stronger structure S. These types of structures occurin our everyday\\'slife, that\\'s why we study them in this book. Thus, as a particular case: A Smarandache groupoid is a groupoid G which has a proper subset S contained in G such that S under the operation of G is a semigroup. We study a factorization of bounded linear maps from an operator space $A$ to its dual space $A^*$. It is shown that $T : A \\\\longrightarrow A^*$ factors through a pair of a column Hilbert spaces $\\\\mathcal{H}_c$ and its dual space if and only if $T$ is a bounded linear form on $A \\\\otimes A$ by the canonical identification equipped with a numerical radius type Haagerup norm. As a consequence, we characterize a bounded linear map from a Banach space to its dual space, which factors through a pair of Hilbert spaces. We introduce a permutation analogue of the celebrated Szemeredi Regularity Lemma, and derive a number of consequences. This tool allows us to provide a structural description of permutations which avoid a specified pattern, a result that permutations which scatter small intervals contain all possible patterns of a given size, a proof that every permutation avoiding a specified pattern has a nearly monotone linear-sized subset, and a ``thin deletion\\'\\' result. We also show how one can count sub-patterns of a permutation with an integral, and relate our results to permutation quasirandomness in a manner analogous to the graph-theoretic setting. A solvmanifold is a compact differentiable manifold M on which a connected solvable Lie group G acts transitively. As the main result, we will see, applying a result of Arapura and Nori on solvable Kaehler groups and some of the author\\'s previous results, that a compact solvmanifold admits a Kaehler structure if and only if it is a finite quotient of a complex torus which has a structure of a complex torus bundle over a complex torus. There are also quite a few comments and remarks on and around this result. Let R be a commutative ring with unity and a let A be a not necessarily commutative R-algebra which is free as an R-module. If I is an ideal in A, one can ask when A/I is also free as an R-module. We show that if A has an admissible system and I has a unital Grobner basis then A/I is free as an R-module. We prove a version of Buchberger\\'s theorem over R and, as a corollary, we obtain a Grobner basis proof of the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem over a commutative ground ring. We prove that a non-spherical irreducible Coxeter group is (directly) indecomposable and that a non-spherical and non-affine Coxeter group is strongly indecomposable in the sense that all its finite index subgroups are (directly) indecomposable. We prove that a Coxeter group has a decomposition as a direct product of indecomposable groups, and that such a decomposition is unique up to a central automorphism and a permutation of the factors. We prove that a Coxeter group has a virtual decomposition as a direct product of strongly indecomposable groups, and that such a decomposition is unique up to commensurability and a permutation of the factors. We exhibit a family of infinite, finitely-presented, nilpotent-by-abelian groups. Each member of this family is a solvable S-arithmetic group that is related to Baumslag-Solitar groups, and everyone of these groups has a quasi-isometry group that is virtually a product of a solvable real Lie group and a solvable p-adic Lie group. In addition, we propose a candidate for a polycyclic group whose quasi-isometry group is a solvable real Lie group, and we introduce a candidate for a quasi-isometrically rigid solvable group that is not finitely presented. We also record some conjectures on the large-scale geometry of lamplighter groups. We show that a formal power series ring $A[[X]]$ over a noetherian ring $A$ is not a projective module unless $A$ is artinian. However, if $(A,{\\\\mathfrak m})$ is local, then $A[[X]]$ behaves like a projective module in the sense that $Ext^p_A(A[[X]], M)=0$ for all ${\\\\mathfrak m}$-adically complete $A$-modules. The latter result is shown more generally for any flat $A$-module $B$ instead of $A[[X]]$. We apply the results to the (analytic) Hochschild cohomology over complete noetherian rings. A classical link in 3-space can be represented by a Gauss paragraph encoding a link diagram in a combinatorial way. A Gauss paragraph may code not a classical link diagram, but a diagram with virtual crossings. We present a criterion and a linear algorithm detecting whether a Gauss paragraph encodes a classical link. We describe Wirtinger presentations realizable by virtual link groups. Let A be a finite nonempty subset of an additive abelian group G, and let \\\\Sigma(A) denote the set of all group elements representable as a sum of some subset of A. We prove that |\\\\Sigma(A)| >= |H| + 1/64 |A H|^2 where H is the stabilizer of \\\\Sigma(A). Our result implies that \\\\Sigma(A) = Z/nZ for every set A of units of Z/nZ with |A| >= 8 \\\\sqrt{n}. This consequence was first proved by Erd\\\\H{o}s and Heilbronn for n prime, and by Vu (with a weaker constant) for general n. For a quantum-mechanically spread-out particle we investigate a method for determining its arrival time at a specific location. The procedure is based on the emission of a first photon from a two-level system moving into a laser-illuminated region. The resulting temporal distribution is explicitly calculated for the one-dimensional case and compared with axiomatically proposed expressions. As a main result we show that by means of a deconvolution one obtains the well known quantum mechanical probability flux of the particle at the location as a limiting distribution. A density matrix approach is developped for the control of a mixed-state quantum system using a time-dependent external field such as a train of pulses. This leads to the definition of a target density matrix constructed in a reduced Hilbert space as a specific combination of the eigenvectors of a given observable through weighting factors related with the initial statistics of the system. A train of pulses is considered as a possible strategy to reach this target. An illustration is given by considering the laser control of molecular alignment / orientation in thermal equilibrium. We provide a model of a one dimensional quantum network, in the framework of a lattice using Von Neumann and Wigner\\'s idea of bound states in a continuum. The localized states acting as qubits are created by a controlled deformation of a periodic potential. These wave functions lie at the band edges and are defects in a lattice. We propose that these defect states, with atoms trapped in them, can be realized in an optical lattice and can act as a model for a quantum network. A new C*-enlargement of a C*-algebra $A$ nested between the local multiplier algebra $M_{\\\\text{loc}}(A)$ of $A$ and its injective envelope $I(A)$ is introduced. Various aspects of this maximal C*-algebra of quotients, $Q_{\\\\text{max}}(A)$, are studied, notably in the setting of AW*-algebras. As a by-product we obtain a new example of a type I C*-algebra $A$ such that $M_{\\\\text{loc}}(M_{\\\\text{loc}}(A))\\\\ne M_{\\\\text{loc}}(A)$. The notions of deleted and restricted arrangements have been useful in the study of arrangements of hyperplanes. If A is an arrangement of hyperplanes, x in A and A\\', A\\'\\' the deleted and restricted arrangements, there is a formula connecting the Poincare polynomials of the complement spaces M(A), M(A\\') and M(A\\'\\'). In this paper, we consider the extension of this formula to arbitrary subspaces arrangements. The main result is the existence of a long exact sequence connecting the rational cohomology of M(A), M(A\\') and M(A\\'\\'). Using this sequence, we obtain new results connecting the Betti numbers and Poincare polynomials of deleted and restricted arrangements. Let G=SL_3(Z/pZ), p a prime. Let A be a set of generators of G. Then A grows under the group operation. To be precise: denote by |S| the number of elements of a finite set S. Assume |A| < |G|^{1-\\\\epsilon} for some \\\\epsilon>0. Then |A\\\\cdot A\\\\cdot A|>|A|^{1+\\\\delta}, where \\\\delta>0 depends only on \\\\epsilon. We also study subsets A\\\\subset G that do not generate G. Other results on growth and generation follow. For $a,\\\\alpha>0$ let $E(a,\\\\alpha)$ be the set of all compact operators $A$ on a separable Hilbert space such that $s_n(A)=O(\\\\exp(-an^\\\\alpha))$, where $s_n(A)$ denotes the $n$-th singular number of $A$. We provide upper bounds for the norm of the resolvent $(zI-A)^{-1}$ of $A$ in terms of a quantity describing the departure from normality of $A$ and the distance of $z$ to the spectrum of $A$. As a consequence we obtain upper bounds for the Hausdorff distance of the spectra of two operators in $E(a,\\\\alpha)$. For a triple $(G,A,\\\\kappa)$ (where $G$ is a group, $A$ is a $G$-module and $\\\\kappa:G^3\\\\to A$ is a 3-cocycle) and a $G$-module $B$ we introduce a new cohomology theory $_2H^n(G,A,\\\\kappa;B)$ which we call the secondary cohomology. We give a construction that associates to a pointed topological space $(X,x_0)$ an invariant $_2\\\\kappa^4\\\\in_2H^4(\\\\pi_1(X),\\\\pi_2(X),\\\\kappa^3;\\\\pi_3(X))$. This construction can be seen a \"3-type\" generalization of the classical $k$-invariant. We define a fat staircase to be a Ferrers diagram corresponding to a partition of the form $(n^{\\\\alpha_n}, {n-1}^{\\\\alpha_{n-1}},..., 1^{\\\\alpha_1})$, where $\\\\alpha = (\\\\alpha_1,...,\\\\alpha_n)$ is a composition, or the $180^\\\\circ$ rotation of such a diagram. If a diagram\\'s skew Schur function is a linear combination of Schur functions of fat staircases, we call the diagram a sum of fat staircases. We prove a Schur-positivity result that is obtained each time we augment a sum of fat staircases with a skew diagram. We also determine conditions on which diagrams can be sums of fat staircases, including necessary and sufficient conditions in the special case when the diagram is a fat staircase skew a single row or column. We present a new form of a Parrondo game using discrete-time quantum walk on a line. The two players A and B with different quantum coins operators, individually losing the game can develop a strategy to emerge as joint winners by using their coins alternatively, or in combination for each step of the quantum walk evolution. We also present a strategy for a player A (B) to have a winning probability more than player B (A). Significance of the game strategy in information theory and physical applications are also discussed. A nanoscale device consisting of a metal nanowire, a dielectric, and a gate is proposed. A combination of quantum and thermal stochastic effects enable the device to have multiple functionalities, serving alternately as a transistor, a variable resistor, or a simple resistive element with $I-V$ characteristics that can switch between ohmic and non-ohmic. By manipulating the gate voltage, stochastic transitions between different conducting states of the nanowire can be induced, with a switching time as short as picoseconds. With an appropriate choice of dielectric, the transconductance of the device can significantly exceed the conductance quantum $G_0=2e^2/h$, a remarkable figure of merit for a device at this lengthscale. A discrete set $A$ in the Euclidian space is almost periodic if the measure with the unite masses at points of the set is almost periodic in the weak sense. We investigate properties of such sets in the case when $A-A$ is discrete. In particular, if $A$ is a Bohr almost periodic set, we prove that $A$ is a union of a finite number of translates of a certain full--rank lattice. If $A$ is a Besicovitch almost periodic set, then there exists a full-rank lattice such that in most cases a nonempty intersection of its translate with $A$ is large. Let $B$ be a bialgebra, and $A$ a left $B$-comodule algebra in a braided monoidal category $\\\\Cc$, and assume that $A$ is also a coalgebra, with a not-necessarily associative or unital left $B$-action. Then we can define a right $A$-action on the tensor product of two relative Hopf modules, and this defines a monoidal structure on the category of relative Hopf modules if and only if $A$ is a bialgebra in the category of left Yetter-Drinfeld modules over $B$. Some examples are given. Let $A$ be a subset of integers and let $2\\\\cdot A+k\\\\cdot A=\\\\{2a_1+ka_2 : a_1,a_2\\\\in A\\\\}$. Y. O. Hamidoune and J. Ru\\\\\\' e proved that if $k$ is an odd prime and $A$ a finite set of integers such that $|A|>8k^k$, then $|2\\\\cdot A+k\\\\cdot A|\\\\ge (k+2)|A|-k^2-k+2$. In this paper, we extend this result for the case when $k$ is a power of an odd prime and the case when $k$ is a product of two odd primes. Let X be a connected topological space admitting a universal cover. Let a be a degree one cohomology class on X. We define and study a two-cocycle on a group acting on X by homeomorphisms preserving the class a. We use this cocycle to investigate group actions on X. For example, we show that if an action preserves a Borel probability measure on X then the cocycle is cohomologically trivial. Under various assumptions on a homeomorphism g, we prove that it is undistorted in Homeo(X,a). In particular, we introduce a local rotation number of a homeomorphism and prove that a homeomorphism with non-constant local rotation number is undistorted. We define a class of algebras describing links of binary isolating formulas on a set of realizations for a family of 1-types of a complete theory. We prove that a set of labels for binary isolating formulas on a set of realizations for a 1-type p forms a groupoid of a special form if there is an atomic model over a realization of p. We describe the class of these groupoids and consider features of these groupoids in a general case and for special theories. A description of the class of partial groupoids relative to families of 1-types is given. We introduce the notion of a Jordan triple module and determine the precise conditions under which every derivation from a JB*-triple E into a Banach (Jordan) triple E-module is continuous. In particular, every derivation from a real or complex JB*-triple into its dual space is automatically continuous. Among the consequences, we prove that every triple derivation from a C*-algebra A to a Banach triple A-module is continuous. In particular, every Jordan derivation from A to a Banach A-bimodule is a derivation, a result which complements a classical theorem due to B.E. Johnson and solves a problem which has remained open for over ten years. A crossed module is (A,H,d,\\\\la) where d:A\\\\to H is a homomorphism of groups and H acts on A, with conditions leading to a groupoid A\\\\lcross H{\\\\to\\\\atop \\\\to}H as an example of a strict 2-group. We give the corresponding notion of a quantum 2-group where we replace the above by Hopf algebras and introduce a new version of quantum groupoid. The work also suggests a natural notion of braided crossed module where A a braided-Hopf algebra in the braided category Z({}_H\\\\CM) of crossed H-modules, although without the full groupoid picture in this more general case. We define a class of algebras describing links of binary semi-isolating formulas on a set of realizations for a family of 1-types of a complete theory. These algebras include algebras of isolating formulas considered before. We prove that a set of labels for binary semi-isolating formulas on a set of realizations for a 1-type forms a monoid of a special form with a partial order inducing ranks for labels, with set-theoretic operations, and with a composition. We describe the class of these structures. A description of the class of structures relative to families of 1-types is given. Given an infinite group $G$ and a subset $A$ of $G$ we let $\\\\Delta(A) = {g \\\\in G : |gA \\\\cap A| =\\\\infty}$ (this is sometimes called the combinatorial derivation of $A$). A subset $A$ of $G$ is called large if there exists a finite subset $F$ of $G$ such that $FA=G$. We show that given a large set $X$, and a decomposition $X=A_1 \\\\cup ... \\\\cup A_n$, there must exist an $i$ such that $\\\\Delta(A_i)$ is large. This answers a question of Protasov. We also answer a number of related questions of Protasov. Let $A$ be an algebra over a commutative ring $k$. It is known that the categories of non-commutative descent data, of comodules over the Sweedler canonical coring, of right $A$-modules with a flat connection are isomorphic as braided monoidal categories to the center of the category of $A$-bimodules. We prove that the braiding on these categories is unique if there exists a $k$-linear unitary map $E : A \\\\to Z(A)$. This condition is satisfied if $k$ is a field or $A$ is a commutative or a separable algebra. Let A be a unital separable simple C*-algebra with a unique tracial state. We prove that if A is nuclear and quasidiagonal, then A tensored with the universal UHF-algebra has decomposition rank at most one. Then it is proved that A is nuclear, quasidiagonal and has strict comparison if and only if A has finite decomposition rank. For such A, we also give a direct proof that A tensored with a UHF-algebra has tracial rank zero. Applying this characterization, we obtain a counter-example to the Powers-Sakai conjecture. Let $A \\\\subseteq F_2^n$ be a set with $|2A| = K|A|$. We prove that if (1) for at least a fraction $1-K^{-9}$ of all $s \\\\in 2A$, the set $(A+s) \\\\cap A$ has size at most $L\\\\cdot|A|/K$, or (2) for at least a fraction $K^{-L}$ of all $s \\\\in 2A$, the set $(A+s) \\\\cap A$ has size at least $|A|\\\\cdot(1- K^{-1/L})$, then there is a subset $B \\\\subseteq A$ of size $|A|/K^{O_L(1)}$ such that $\\\\mathrm{span}(B) \\\\leq K^{O_L(1)}\\\\cdot|A|$. In this paper, we shall characterize the components of the polar decomposition for an arbitrary $J$-unitary operator in a Hilbert space. This characterization has a quite different structure as that for complex symmetric and complex skew-symmetric operators. It is also shown that for a $J$-imaginary closed symmetric operator in a Hilbert space there exists a $J$-imaginary self-adjoint extension in a possibly larger Hilbert space (a linear operator $A$ in a Hilbert space $H$ is said to be $J$-imaginary if $f\\\\in D(A)$ implies $Jf\\\\in D(A)$ and $AJf = -JAf$, where $J$ is a conjugation on $H$). A positroid is the matroid of a matrix whose maximal minors are all nonnegative. Given a permutation $w$ in $S_n$, the matroid of a generic $n \\\\times n$ matrix whose non-zero entries in row $i$ lie in columns $w(i)$ through $n+i$ is an example of a positroid. We enumerate the bases of such a positroid as a sum of certain products of Catalan numbers, each term indexed by the $123$-avoiding permutations above $w$ in Bruhat order. We also give a similar sum formula for their Tutte polynomials. These are both avatars of a structural result writing such a positroid as a disjoint union of matroids, each isomorphic to a direct sum of Catalan matroids and a matroid with one basis. For a complex $n$-by-$n$ matrix $A$, the numerical range $F(A)$ is the range of the map $f_A(x) = x^*A x$ acting on the unit sphere in $\\\\C^n$. We ask whether the multivalued inverse numerical range map $f_A^{-1}$ has a continuous single-valued selection defined on all or part of $F(A)$. We show that for a large class of matrices, $f_A^{-1}$ does have a continuous selection on $F(A)$. For other matrices, $f_A^{-1}$ has a continuous selection defined everywhere on $F(A)$ except in the vicinity of a finite number of exceptional points on the boundary of $F(A)$. Let $(H,\\\\a)$ be a Hom-Hopf algebra and $(A,\\\\b)$ be a Hom-algebra. In this paper we will construct the Hom-crossed product $(A\\\\#_\\\\sigma H,\\\\b\\\\o\\\\a)$, and prove that the extension $A\\\\subseteq A\\\\#_\\\\sigma H$ is actually a Hom-type cleft extension and vice versa. Then we will give the necessary and sufficient conditions to make $(A\\\\#_\\\\sigma H,\\\\b\\\\o\\\\a)$ a Hom-Hopf algebra. Finally we will study the lazy 2-cocycle on $(H,\\\\a)$. Let $A$ and $B$ be algebras and coalgebras in a braided monoidal category $\\\\Cc$, and suppose that we have a cross product algebra and a cross coproduct coalgebra structure on $A\\\\ot B$. We present necessary and sufficient conditions for $A\\\\ot B$ to be a bialgebra, and sufficient conditions for $A\\\\ot B$ to be a Hopf algebra. We discuss when such a cross product Hopf algebra is a double cross (co)product, a biproduct, or, more generally, a smash (co)product Hopf algebra. In each of these cases, we provide an explicit description of the associated Hopf algebra projection. A conducting disk significantly changes the generation of the electromagnetic radiation excited by the rotation of the magnetic field frozen to a star. Due to the reflection of waves from a disk there appear waves propagating toward a star, not only outward a star as it takes place for the magneto-dipole radiation. Because that the angular momentum can be transformed from a disk to a star when the inner edge of a disk approaches the light surface of a rotating star. This is purely electromagnetic effect. At some distance of a disk from a star, $r_d=r^*\\\\simeq c/\\\\omega_s$, the stellar angular momentum losses due to the electromagnetic radiation become zero. It results the stable stellar rotation. We construct a universal continuous invariant bilinear form for the Lie algebra of compactly supported sections of a Lie algebra bundle in a topological sense. Moreover we construct a universal continuous central extension of a current algebra that is the tensor product of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra g and a certain topological algebra A. In particular taking A as the compactly supported smooth functions on a sigma-compact manifold M, we obtain a more detailed justification for a recent result of Janssens and Wockel concerning a universal extension for the Lie algebra of compactly supported g-valued smooth functions on M. Let $A=\\\\bigoplus_{p\\\\in G}A_{p}$ be a multiplier Hopf $T$-coalgebra over a group $G$, in this paper we give the definition of the crossed left $A$-$G$-modules and show that the category of crossed left $A$-$G$-modules is a monoidal category. Finally we show that a family of multipliers $R = \\\\{R_{p, q} \\\\in M(A_{p}\\\\otimes A_{q})\\\\}_{p, q\\\\in G}$ is a quasitriangular structure of a multiplier $T$-coalgebra $A$ if and only if the crossed left $A$-$G$-module category over $A$ is a braided monoidal category with the braiding $c$ defined by $R$, generalizing the main results in \\\\cite{ZCL11} to the more general framework of multiplier Hopf algebras. Given a w*-closed unital algebra $A$ acting on $H_0$ and a contractive w*-continuous endomorphism $\\\\beta$ of $A$, there is a w*-closed (non-selfadjoint) unital algebra $\\\\mathbb{Z}_+\\\\bar{\\\\times}_\\\\beta A$ acting on $H_0\\\\otimes\\\\ell^2({\\\\mathbb{Z}_+})$, called the w*-semicrossed product of $A$ with $\\\\beta$. We prove that the w*-semicrossed product is a reflexive operator algebra provided $A$ is reflexive and $\\\\beta$ is unitarily implemented, and that it has the bicommutant property if and only if so does $A$. Also, we show that the w*-semicrossed product generated by a commutative C*-algebra and a *-endomorphism is reflexive. Let A= (a_{ij}) be a symmetric non-negative integer 2k x 2k matrix. A is homogeneous if a_{ij} + a_{kl}=a_{il} + a_{kj} for any choice of the four indexes. Let A be a homogeneous matrix and let F be a general form in C[x_1, \\\\dots x_n] with 2deg(F) = trace(A). We look for the least integer, s(A), so that F= pfaff(M_1) + \\\\cdots + pfaff(M_{s(A)}), where the M_i\\'s are 2k x 2k skew-symmetric matrices of forms with degree matrix A. We consider this problem for n= 4 and we prove that s(A) < k+1 for all A. A simple matrix is a (0,1)-matrix with no repeated columns. For a (0,1)-matrix $F$, we say that a (0,1)-matrix $A$ has $F$ as a configuration if there is a submatrix of $A$ which is a row and column permutation of $F$ (trace is the set system version of a configuration). Let $\\\\ncols{A}$ denote the number of columns of $A$. Let ${\\\\cal F}$ be a family of matrices. We define the extremal function $forb(m,{\\\\cal F})=\\\\max{\\\\ncols{A} : A is m-rowed simple matrix and has no configuration F\\\\in{\\\\cal F}}$. We consider some families ${\\\\cal F}=\\\\{F_1,F_2,\\\\ldots, F_t\\\\}$ such that individually each $\\\\forb(m,F_i)$ has greater asymptotic growth than $\\\\forb(m,{\\\\cal F})$. Let $A$ be a Banach algebra with a non-empty character space. We say that a bounded net $\\\\{e_{\\\\alpha}\\\\}$ in $A$ is a bounded $\\\\Delta$-weak approximate identity for $A$ if, for each $a\\\\in A$ and compact subset $K$ of $\\\\Delta(A)$, $||\\\\widehat{e_{\\\\alpha}a}-\\\\widehat{a}||_{K}=\\\\sup_{\\\\phi\\\\in K}|\\\\phi(e_{\\\\alpha}a)-\\\\phi(a)|\\\\rightarrow 0$. For each $1<p<\\\\infty$, we prove that the Figa-Talamanca Herz algebra, $A_{p}(G)$ has a bounded $\\\\Delta$-weak approximate identity if and only if $G$ is an amenable group. Also we give a sufficient condition for amenability of group $G$. A P-set of a symmetric matrix $A$ is a set $\\\\alpha$ of indices such that the nullity of the matrix obtained from $A$ by removing rows and columns indexed by $\\\\alpha$ is $|\\\\alpha|$ more than that of $A$. It is known that each subset of a P-set is a P-set. It is also known that a set of indices such that each singleton subset is a P-set need not be a P-set. This note shows that if all pairs of vertices of a set with at least two elements are P-sets, then the set is a P-set. Let $R$ be a finite valuation ring of order $q^r$ where $q$ is odd and $A$ be a subset $R$. We prove that there exists a point $u$ in the Cartesian product $A\\\\times A\\\\subset R^2$ such that the size of the pinned distance set at $u$ satisfies $$|\\\\Delta_u(A\\\\times A)|\\\\gg \\\\min\\\\left\\\\{q^r, \\\\frac{|A|^3}{q^{2r-1}}\\\\right\\\\}.$$ This implies that if $|A|\\\\ge q^{r-\\\\frac{1}{3}}$, then $A\\\\times A$ determines a positive proportion of all possible distances. We show that a short relativistic electron beam propagating in a plasma with a density gradient perpendicular to the direction of motion generates a wakefield in which a witness bunch experiences a transverse force. A density gradient oscillating along the beam path would create a periodically varying force---an undulator, with an estimated strength of the equivalent magnetic field more than ten Tesla. This opens an avenue for creation of a high-strength, short-period undulators, which eventually may lead to all-plasma, free electron lasers where a plasma wakefield acceleration is naturally combined with a plasma undulator in a unifying, compact setup. Two non-empty sets $A,B$ of a metric space $(X,d)$ are called parallel if $d(a,B)=d(A,B)=d(A,b)$ for any points $a\\\\in A$ and $b\\\\in B$. Answering a question posed on Mathoverflow, we prove that for a cover $\\\\mathcal C$ of a metrizable space $X$ the following conditions are equivalent: (i) the topology of $X$ is generated by a metric $d$ such that any two sets $A,B\\\\in\\\\mathcal C$ are parallel; (ii) the cover $\\\\mathcal C$ is disjoint, lower semicontinuous and upper semicontinuous. Let $n\\\\in \\\\Bbb N-\\\\{1\\\\},$ and let $A$ be a Banach algebra. An additive map $D: A\\\\to A$ is called n-Jordan derivation if $$D(a^n)=D(a)a^{n-1}+aD(a)a^{n-2}+...+a^{n-2}D(a)a+a^{n-1}D(a),$$ for all $a \\\\in {A}$. Using fixed point methods, we investigate the stability of n--Jordan derivations (n--Jordan $^*-$derivations) on Banach algebras ($C^*-$algebras). Also we show that to each approximate $^*-$Jordan derivation $f$ in a $C^*-$ algebra there corresponds a unique $^*-$derivation near to $f$. The main result in this paper concerns a new five-variable expander. It is proven that for any finite set of real numbers $A$, $$|\\\\{(a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4)^2+\\\\log a_5 :a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5 \\\\in A \\\\}| \\\\gg \\\\frac{|A|^2}{\\\\log |A|}.$$ This bound is optimal, up to logarithmic factors. The paper also gives new lower bounds for $|A(A-A)|$ and $|A(A+A)|$, improving on results from arXiv:1312.6438. The new bounds are $$|A(A-A)| \\\\gtrapprox |A|^{3/2+\\\\frac{1}{34}}$$ and $$|A(A+A)| \\\\gtrapprox |A|^{3/2+\\\\frac{5}{242}}.$$ We give a characterization of countable discrete subspace $A$ of a topological space $X$ such that there exists a (linear) continuous mapping $\\\\varphi:C_p^*(A)\\\\to C_p(X)$ with $\\\\varphi(y)|_A=y$ for every $y\\\\in C_p^*(A)$. Using this characterization we answer two questions of A.~Arhangel\\'skii. Moreover, we introduce the notion of well-covered subset of a topological space and prove that for well-covered functionally closed subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ there exists a linear continuous mapping $\\\\varphi:C_p(A)\\\\to C_p(X)$ with $\\\\varphi(y)|_A=y$ for every $y\\\\in C_p(A)$. We embed Duquesne and Le Gall\\'s stable tree into a binary compact continuum random tree (CRT) in a way that solves an open problem posed by Goldschmidt and Haas. This CRT can be obtained by applying a recursive construction method of compact CRTs as presented in earlier work to a specific distribution of a random string of beads, i.e. a random interval equipped with a random discrete measure. We also express this CRT as a tree built by replacing all branch points of a stable tree by rescaled i.i.d. copies of a Ford CRT. Some of these developments are carried out in a space of infinity-marked metric spaces generalising Miermont\\'s notion of a k-marked metric space. $\\\\textbf{Theorem 1.3.}$ For a given ring $A$ with right Goldie radical $G(A_A)$, the following conditions are equivalent. $\\\\textbf{1)}$ Every non-singular right $A$-module $X$ which is is injective with respect to some essential right ideal of the ring $A$ is an injective module. $\\\\textbf{2)}$ $A/G(A_A)$ is a right strongly semiprime ring. $\\\\textbf{Theorem 1.4.}$ For a given ring $A$, the following conditions are equivalent. $\\\\textbf{1)}$ $A$ is a right strongly semiprime ring. $\\\\textbf{2)}$ Every right $A$-module which is injective with respect to some essential right ideal of the ring $A$, is an injective module and $A$ is right non-singular. We introduce a Kauffman-Jones type polynomial $\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\gamma}(A)$ for a curve $\\\\gamma$ on an oriented surface, whose endpoints are on the boundary of the surface. The polynomial $\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\gamma}(A)$ is a Laurent polynomial in one variable $A$ and is an invariant of the homotopy class of $\\\\gamma$. As an application, we obtain an estimate in terms of the span of $\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\gamma}(A)$ for the minimum self-intersection number of a curve within its homotopy class. We then give a chord diagrammatic description of $\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\gamma}(A)$ and show some computational results on the span of $\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\gamma}(A)$. A vertex cover of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a set $X \\\\subseteq V$ such that each edge of $G$ is incident to at least one vertex of $X$. A dominating set $D \\\\subseteq V$ is a total dominating set of $G$ if the subgraph induced by $D$ has no isolated vertices. A $(\\\\gamma_t-\\\\tau)$-set of $G$ is a minimum vertex cover which is also a minimum total dominating set. In this article we give a constructive characterization of trees having a $(\\\\gamma_t-\\\\tau)$-set. We observe that under certain conditions on the Lyapunov exponents a semi-invertible cocycle is, indeed, invertible. As a consequence, if a semi-invertible cocycle generated by a H\\\\\"{o}lder continuous map $A:M\\\\to M(d, \\\\mathbb{R})$ over a hyperbolic map $f:M\\\\to M$ satisfies a Liv\\\\v{s}ic\\'s type condition, that is, if $A(f^{n-1}(p))\\\\cdot\\\\ldots \\\\cdot A(f(p))A(p)=\\\\text{Id}$ for every $p\\\\in \\\\text{Fix}(f^n)$ then the cocycle is invertible, meaning that $A(x)\\\\in GL(d,\\\\mathbb{R})$ for every $x\\\\in M$, and a Liv\\\\v{s}ic\\'s type theorem is satisfied. The energy eigenstates of a spin$-\\\\frac{1}{2}$ particle in a magnetic field confined to a plane, define a planar spin. If the particle moves adiabatically around a loop in this plane, it picks up a topological Berry phase that can only be an integer multiple of $\\\\pi$. We propose a neutron interferometry test of the Berry phase for a circulating planar spin induced by a magnetic field caused by a very long current-carrying straight wire perpendicular to the plane. This Berry phase causes destructive interference in the direction of the incoming beam of thermal neutrons moving through a triple-Laue interferometer. A sequence of scalars is said to be admissible for a positive operator A on a Hilbert space if it is the diagonal of VAV* for some partial isometry V having as domain the closure of the range of A. When A is a projection, the celebrated Kadison\\'s carpenter theorem provides a sufficient condition for a sequence to be admissible for A. We prove that the same condition is sufficient for the sequence to be admissible for A when A is a sum of projections (converging in the SOT). This provides an independent proof of Kadison\\'s carpenter theorem. Let $a$ be a real number satisfying $0<a<\\\\pi$. We denote by $M_n(a)$ the configuration space of regular spherical $n$-gons with side-lengths $a$. The purpose of this paper is to determine $\\\\chi (M_n(a))$ for all $a$ and odd $n$. To do so, we construct a manifold $X_n$ and a function $\\\\mu: X_n \\\\to \\\\mathbf{R}$ such that $\\\\mu^{-1}(a)=M_n(a)$. In fact, the function $\\\\mu$ is different from the well-known \"wall-crossing\" function. We determine the index of each critical point of $\\\\mu$. Since a level set is obtained by successive Morse surgeries, we can determine $\\\\chi (M_n(a))$. For a given intuitionistic propositional formula A and a propositional variable x occurring in it, define the infinite sequence of formulae { A \\\\_i | i$\\\\ge$1} by letting A\\\\_1 be A and A\\\\_{i+1} be A(A\\\\_i/x). Ruitenburg\\'s Theorem [8] says that the sequence { A \\\\_i } (modulo logical equivalence) is ultimately periodic with period 2, i.e. there is N $\\\\ge$ 0 such that A N+2 $\\\\leftrightarrow$ A N is provable in intuitionistic propositional calculus. We give a semantic proof of this theorem, using duality techniques and bounded bisimulations ranks. Let A be a unital algebra over a commutative unital ring R. We say that A is a SLIP algebra if every R-linear map on A that leaves invariant every left ideal of A is a left multiplier. In this paper we study whether a triangular algebra Tri(A,M,B) is a SLIP algebra and give some necessary or sufficient conditions for a triangular algebra be a SLIP algebra, and various examples are given which illustrate limitations on extending some of the theory developed. Then our results are applied to generalized triangular matrix algebras and block upper triangular algebras. Also, some SLIP algebras other that triangular algebras are provided. When $A$ is a matrix with all eigenvalues in the disk $|z-1|<1$, the principal $p$th root of $A$ can be computed by Schr\\\\\"oder\\'s method, among many other methods. In this paper we present a further study of Schr\\\\\"oder\\'s method for the matrix $p$th root, through an examination of power series expansions of some sequences of scalar functions. Specifically, we obtain a new and informative error estimate for the matrix sequence generated by the Schr\\\\\"oder\\'s method, a monotonic convergence result when $A$ is a nonsingular $M$-matrix, and a structure preserving result when $A$ is a nonsingular $M$-matrix or a real nonsingular $H$-matrix with positive diagonal entries. Let $(A,\\\\mathfrak{m})$ be a Henselian Cohen-Macaulay local ring and let CM(A) be the category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay $A$-modules. We construct $T \\\\colon CM(A)\\\\times CM(A) \\\\rightarrow mod(A)$, a subfunctor of $Ext^1_A(-, -)$ and use it to study properties of associated graded modules over $G(A) = \\\\bigoplus_{n\\\\geq 0} \\\\mathfrak{m}^n/\\\\mathfrak{m}^{n+1}$, the associated graded ring of $A$. As an application we give several examples of complete Cohen-Macaulay local rings $A$ with $G(A)$ Cohen-Macaulay and having distinct indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules $M_n$ with $G(M_n)$ Cohen-Macaulay and the set $\\\\{e(M_n)\\\\}$ bounded (here $e(M)$ denotes multiplicity of $M$). We consider a multiplicative variation on the classical Kowalski-S\\\\l{}odkowski Theorem which identifies the characters among the collection of all functionals on a Banach algebra $A$. In particular we show that, if $A$ is a $C^*$-algebra, and if $\\\\phi:A\\\\mapsto\\\\mathbb C$ is a continuous function satisfying $\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf 1)=1$ and $\\\\phi(x)\\\\phi(y) \\\\in \\\\sigma(xy)$ for all $x,y\\\\in A$ (where $\\\\sigma$ denotes the spectrum), then $\\\\phi$ generates a corresponding character $\\\\psi_\\\\phi$ on $A$ which coincides with $\\\\phi$ on the principal component of the invertible group of $A$. We also show that, if $A$ is any Banach algebra whose elements have totally disconnected spectra, then, under the aforementioned conditions, $\\\\phi$ is always a character. A linear mapping $\\\\phi$ from an algebra $\\\\mathcal{A}$ into its bimodule $\\\\mathcal M$ is called a centralizable mapping at $G\\\\in\\\\mathcal{A}$ if $\\\\phi(AB)=\\\\phi(A)B=A\\\\phi(B)$ for each $A$ and $B$ in $\\\\mathcal{A}$ with $AB=G$. In this paper, we prove that if $\\\\mathcal M$ is a von Neumann algebra without direct summands of type $\\\\mathrm{I}_1$ and type $\\\\mathrm{II}$, $\\\\mathcal A$ is a $*$-subalgebra with $\\\\mathcal M\\\\subseteq\\\\mathcal A\\\\subseteq LS(\\\\mathcal{M})$ and $G$ is a fixed element in $\\\\mathcal A$, then every continuous (with respect to the local measure topology $t(\\\\mathcal M)$) centralizable mapping at $G$ from $\\\\mathcal A$ into $\\\\mathcal M$ is a centralizer. A complex orthogonal (geometric) structure on a complex manifold is a geometric structure locally modelled on a non-degenerate quadric. One of the first examples of such a structure on a compact manifold of dimension three was constructed by Guillot. In this paper, we show that the same manifold carries a family of uniformizable complex orthogonal (geometric) structures which includes Guillot\\'s structure; here, a structure is said to be uniformizable if it is a quotient of an invariant open set of a quadric by a Kleinian group. We also construct a family of uniformizable complex (geometric) projective structures on a related compact complex manifold of dimension three. We consider a square random matrix of size $N$ of the form $P(Y,A)$ where $P$ is a noncommutative polynomial, $A$ is a tuple of deterministic matrices converging in $\\\\ast$-distribution, when $N$ goes to infinity, towards a tuple $a$ in some $\\\\mathcal{C}^*$-probability space and $Y$ is a tuple of independent matrices with i.i.d. centered entries with variance $1/N$. We investigate the eigenvalues of $P(Y,A)$ outside the spectrum of $P(c,a)$ where $c$ is a circular system which is free from $a$. We provide a sufficient condition to guarantee that these eigenvalues coincide asymptotically with those of $P(0,A)$. We introduce the notion of orthogonality in a vector space with a topology on it. To serve our purpose, we define orthogonality space for a given vector space X, using the topology on it. We show that for a suitable choice of orthogonality space, Birkhoff-James orthogonality in a Banach space is a particular case of the orthogonality introduced by us. We characterize the right additivity of orthogonality in our setting and obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a Banach space to be smooth as a corollary to our characterization. Finally, using our notion of orthogonality, we obtain a topological generalization of the Bhatia-Semrl Theorem. Let $A$ be a finite dimensional algebra over a field $k$ and $\\\\textbf{P}$ be a 2-term silting complex in $K^{b}(\\\\text{proj}A)$. In this paper, we investigate the representation dimension of $\\\\text{End}_{D^{b}(A)} (\\\\textbf{P})$ by using the silting theory. We show that if $\\\\textbf{P}$ is a separating silting complex with certain homological restriction, then rep.dim $A=$rep.dim $\\\\text{End}_{D^{b}(A)}(\\\\textbf{P})$. This gives a proper generalization of the classical compare theorem of representation dimensions showed by Chen and Hu. It is well-known that $\\\\text{H}^{0}(\\\\textbf{P})$ is a tilting $A/\\\\text{ann}_{A} (\\\\textbf{P})$-module. We also show that rep.dim $\\\\text{End}_{A} (\\\\text{H}^{0}(\\\\textbf{P})) = $rep.dim $A/\\\\text{ann}_{A} (\\\\textbf{P})$ if $\\\\textbf{P}$ is a separating and splitting silting complex. Let $k$ be a global field, let $A$ be a Dedekind domain with $\\\\text{Quot}(A) = k$, and let $K$ be a finitely generated field. Using a unified approach for both elliptic curves and Drinfeld modules $M$ defined over $K$ and having a trivial endomorphism ring, with $k= \\\\mathbb{Q}$, $A = \\\\mathbb{Z}$ in the former case and $k$ a global function field, $A$ its ring of functions regular away from a fixed prime in the latter case, for any nonzero ideal $\\\\mathfrak{a} \\\\lhd A$ we prove best possible estimates in the norm $|\\\\mathfrak{a}|$ for the degrees over $K$ of the subfields of the $\\\\mathfrak{a}$-division fields of $M$ fixed by scalars. We introduce generalized Kazdan-Warner equations on Riemannian manifolds associated with a linear action of a torus on a complex vector space. We show the existence and the uniqueness of the solution of the equation on any compact Riemannian manifold. As an application, we give a direct proof of the Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence for the solutions of the Abelian vortex equations on a compact K\\\\\"ahler manifold which are associated with a linear action of a torus on a complex vector space. Our generalized Kazdan-Warner equations for a special action of a torus give rise to the $tt^\\\\ast$ equations. In this paper, we introduce and study a cyclic cohomology theory $H^\\\\bullet_\\\\lambda(A,C,\\\\psi)$ for an entwining structure $(A,C,\\\\psi)$ over a field $k$. We then provide a complete description of the cocycles and the coboundaries in this theory using entwined traces applied to dg-entwining structures over $(A,C,\\\\psi)$. We then apply these descriptions to construct a pairing $ H^m_\\\\lambda(A,C,\\\\psi) \\\\otimes H^n_\\\\lambda(A\\',C\\',\\\\psi\\') \\\\longrightarrow H^{m+n}_\\\\lambda(A \\\\otimes A\\', C \\\\otimes C\\', \\\\psi \\\\otimes \\\\psi\\') $, where $(A,C,\\\\psi)$ and $(A\\',C\\',\\\\psi\\')$ are entwining structures. Let $X$ be a compact metric space, let $A$ be a unital AH algebra with large matrix sizes, and let $B$ be a stably finite unital C*-algebra. Then we give a lower bound for the radius of comparison of $C(X) \\\\otimes B$ and prove that the dimension-rank ratio satisfies $\\\\operatorname{drr} (A) = \\\\operatorname{drr} \\\\left(C(X)\\\\otimes A\\\\right)$. We also give a class of unital AH algebras $A$ with $\\\\operatorname{rc} \\\\left(C(X) \\\\otimes A\\\\right) = \\\\operatorname{rc} (A)$. We further give a class of stably finite exact $\\\\mathcal{Z}$-stable unital C*-algebras with nonzero radius of comparison. We propose a simple dynamical model for a glass transition. The dynamics is described by a Langevin equation in a piecewise parabolic free energy landscape, modulated by a temperature dependent overall curvature. The zero-curvature point marks a transition to a phase with broken ergodicity which we identify as the glass transition. Our analysis shows a connection between the high and low frequency response of systems approaching this transition. We present a calculation of a solitary wave propagating along a cylindrical Bose-Einstein trap, which is found to be a hybrid of a one-dimensional (1D) soliton and a three-dimensional (3D) vortex ring. The calculated energy-momentum dispersion exhibits characteristics similar to those of a mode proposed sometime ago by Lieb within a 1D model, as well as some rotonlike features. We prove that there exists a metric of positive curvature in a three-sphere which admits a given torus knot as a closed geodesic.We also sketch a construction of a metric in a four sphere, very likely of positive curvature, which admits a totally geodesic projective plane with Euler number four. Surpisingly, the technique borrows a lot from the Mostow-Siu-Gromov-Thurston constuction of exotic negatively curved manifolds. We derive a uniform bound for the total betti number of a closed manifold in terms of a Ricci curvature lower bound, a conjugate radius lower bound and a diameter upper bound. The result is based on an angle version of Toponogov comparison estimate for small triangles in a complete manifold with a Ricci curvature lower bound. We also give a uniform estimate on the generators of the fundamental group and prove a fibration theorem in this setting. A q-deformed two-dimensional phase space is studied as a model for a noncommutative phase space. A lattice structure arises that can be interpreted as a spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. The eigenfunctions of a Hamiltonian that lives on such a lattice are derived as wavefunctions in ordinary $x$-space. We suggest a super Poincar\\\\\\'e invariant action for closed eleven dimensional superstring. The sector of physical variables $x^i$, $\\\\theta_a$, $\\\\bar\\\\theta_{\\\\dot a}$, with $a,\\\\dot a=1...8$ and $x^i$ the transverse part of the D=11 $x^\\\\mu$ coordinate is shown to possess free dynamics. We consider a scalar field interacting with a quantized metric varying on a submanifold (e.g. a scalar field interacting with a quantized gravitational wave). We explicitly sum up the perturbation series for the time-ordered vacuum expectation values of the scalar field. As a result we obtain a modified non-canonical short distance behavior. This is a revised version of ANT-0045. If K is a number field of degree n with discriminant D, if K=Q(a) then H(a)>c(n)|D|^(1/(2n-2)) where H(a) is the height of the minimal polynomial of a. We ask if one can always find a generator a of K such that d(n)|D|^(1/(2n-2))>H(a) holds. The answer is yes for real quadratic fields. We use the notion of Milnor fibres of the germ of a meromorphic function and the method of partial resolutions for a study of topology of a polynomial map at infinity (mainly for calculation of the zeta-function of a monodromy). It gives effective methods of computation of the zeta-function for a number of cases and a criterium for a value to be atypical at infinity. We compute the number of rhombus tilings of a hexagon with side lengths a,b,c,a,b,c which contain the central rhombus and the number of rhombus tilings of a hexagon with side lengths a,b,c,a,b,c which contain the `almost central` rhombus above the centre. We show that if a split link is obtained from a split link $L$ in $S^3$ by $1/n$-Dehn surgery along a trivial knot $C$, then the link $L\\\\cup C$ is splittable. That is to say, it is impossible to obtain a split link from a split link via a non-trivial twisting. As its corollary, we completely determine when a trivial link is obtained from a trivial link via a twisting. A (partial) Latin square is a table of multiplication of a (partial) quasigroup. Multiplication of a (partial) quasigroup may be considered as a set of triples. We give a necessary and sufficient condition when a set of triples is a quotient of a (partial) Latin square. Let q be a prime, A be a subset of a finite field $F=\\\\Bbb Z/q\\\\Bbb Z$, $|A|<\\\\sqrt{|F|}$. We prove the estimate $\\\\max(|A+A|,|A\\\\cdot A|)\\\\ge c|A|^{1+\\\\epsilon}$ for some $\\\\epsilon>0$ and c>0. This extends the result of J. Bourgain, N. Katz, and T. Tao. We show that the equivariant chain complex associated to a minimal CW-structure X on the complement M(A) of a hyperplane arrangement A, is independent of X. When A is a sufficiently general linear section of an aspheric arrangement, we explain a new way for computing the twisted homology of M(A). We show that the Connes-Moscovici cyclic cohomology of a Hopf algebra equipped with a character has a Lie bracket of degree -2. More generally, we show that a \"cyclic operad with multiplication\" is a cocyclic module whose cohomology is a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra and whose cyclic cohomology is a graded Lie algebra of degree -2. This explain why the Hochschild cohomology algebra of a symmetric algebra is a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra. Let $D(s)$ be a fractional derivation of order $s$. For a real $p\\\\ne 0$, we construct an integral operator $A(p)$ in an appropriate functional space such that $A(p) D(s) A(p)^{-1}=D(p s)$ for all $s$. The kernel of the operator $A(p)$ is expressed in terms of a function similar to the stable densities. Let $(A,\\\\mathfrak{m})$ be a Noetherian local ring, $M$ a finite $A$-module and $x_1,...,x_n\\\\in \\\\m$ such that $\\\\lambda (M/\\\\x M)$ is finite. Serre proved that all partial Euler characteristics of $M$ with respect to $\\\\x$ is non-negative. This fact is easy to show when $A$ contains a field. We give an elementary proof of Serre\\'s result when $A$ does not contain a field. Let $n$ be a large number. A subset $A$ of $Z_n$ is complete if $S_A = Z_n$, where $S_A$ is the collection of the subset sums of $A$. Olson proved that if $n$ is a prime and $|A|> 2n^{1/2} $, then $S_A$ is complete. We show that a similar result for the case when $n$ is a composite number, using a different approach. This text gives a construction of a differential graded Lie algebra in Nori\\'s category of effective homological motives. In fact the construction works in more a general setting than that of an Abelian category. This allows us to give the rational homotopy Lie algebra of a 1-connected space a motivic structure. As a consequence the rational homotopy Lie algebra inherits a mixed Hodge structure and Galois module structure. We establish a uniform comparison between the spectrum of the rough Laplacian (acting on sections of a vector bundle of complex rank one or of harmonic curvature) with the spectrum of a discrete operator (a generalization of a discrete magnetic Laplacian added with a potential) acting on a finite dimensional space coming from a discretization process. As an application, we obtain a comparison of the first positive eigenvalue of the rough Laplacian with the holonomy. A Wiener-Hopf operator on a Banach space of functions on R+ is a bounded operator T such that P^+S_{-a}TS_a=T, for every positive a, where S_a is the operator of translation by a. We obtain a representation theorem for the Wiener-Hopf operators on a large class of functions on R+ with values in a separable Hilbert space. Circular orbits of a particle sliding on a frictionless surface of revolution about a vertical axis are unstable below a critical radius if the curvature of the surface satisfies a specified condition. This behavior can be realized in a mechanical model, which give a glimpse of the greater complexity of particle orbits in curved rather than flat spacetime. Using a method of a Raman effect of light the heterodiffusion in molecular crystals is investigated by the example of p-dichlorobenzene in a p-dibromobenzene. The installation diagram and a procedure of a determination of diffusivities using this method is given. Changes of diffusivities in a cut of a crystal perpendicularly to a direction of diffusion are found. Obtained values of diffusivities are in good agreement with those obtained by other methods. We present a quantum probabilistic algorithm which tests with a polynomial computational complexity whether a given composite number is of the Carmichael type. We also suggest a quantum algorithm which could verify a conjecture by Pomerance, Selfridge and Wagstaff concerning the asymptotic distribution of Carmichael numbers smaller than a given integer. For the heat equation in a bounded domain we give a stability result for a smooth diffusion coefficient. The key ingredients are a global Carleman-type estimate, a Poincar\\\\\\'e-type estimate and an energy estimate with a single observation acting on a part of the boundary. This paper is motivated by Grothendieck\\'s splitting theorem. In the 1960s, Gohberg generalized this to a class of Banach bundles. We consider a compact complex manifold $X$ and a holomorphic Banach bundle $E \\\\to X$ that is a compact perturbation of a trivial bundle in a sense recently introduced by Lempert. We prove that $E$ splits into the sum of a finite rank bundle and a trivial bundle, provided $H^{1}(X, \\\\O)=0$. We calculate equilibrium and nonequilibrium Casimir-Polder force felt by a small particle (an atom)near a flat substrate using the framework of fluctuation electrodynamics in configuration of a small sphere above a flat substrate. A numerical example is given for a SiC micron -sized particle above a SiC substrate. Different temperature configurations are considered. In this paper we derive a general expression for the emission rate of an emitter which is placed at the center of a real cavity drilled in a generic random medium. We apply our formalism to the computation of the decay rate of a single atom which seats within a small molecule embedded in a continuous medium. The article gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a Frobenius manifold to be a CDV-structure. We show that there exists a positive definite CDV-structure on any semi-simple Frobenius manifold. We also compare three natural connections on a CDV-structure and conclude that the underlying Hermitian manifold of a non-trivial CDV-structure is not a Kahler manifold. Finally, we compute the harmonic potential of a harmonic Frobenius manifolds. We introduce a notion of a connection on a coherent sheaf on a weighted projective line (in the sense of Geigle and Lenzing). Using a theorem of Huebner and Lenzing we show, under a mild hypothesis, that if one considers coherent sheaves equipped with such a connection, and one passes to the perpendicular category to a nonzero vector bundle without self-extensions, then the resulting category is equivalent to the category of representations of a deformed preprojective algebra. A completeness conjecture is advanced concerning the free small-colimit completion P(A) of a (possibly large) category A. The conjecture is based on the existence of a small generating-cogenerating set of objects in A. We sketch how the validity of the result would lead to the existence of an Isbell-Lambek bicompletion C(A) of such an A, without a \"change-of-universe\" procedure being necessary to describe or discuss the bicompletion. Let $R$ be an integral domain and $A$ a symmetric cellular algebra over $R$ with a cellular basis $\\\\{C_{S,T}^\\\\lam \\\\mid \\\\lam\\\\in\\\\Lambda, S,T\\\\in M(\\\\lam)\\\\}$. We will construct an ideal $L(A)$ of the center of $A$ and prove that $L(A)$ contains the so-called Higman ideal. When $R$ is a field, we prove that the dimension of $L(A)$ is not less than the number of non-isomorphic simple $A$-modules. We describe a notion of (abstract) projective line over a field as a set equipped with a certain first order structure, and a projectivity between projective lines as a bijection preserving this structure. The structure in question is that of a groupoid, with certain properties. This leads to a natural notion of bundle of projective lines, forming a stack. Let A be a principally polarized abelian threefold over a perfect field k, not isomorphic to a product over the algebraic closure of k. There exists a canonical extension k\\' of k, of degree 1 or 2, such that A becomes isomorphic to a Jacobian over k\\'. The aim of this note is to give a geometric construction of this extension. Let $a$ and $b$ be two integers such that $2\\\\le a<b$. In this article we define the notion of $(a,b)$-Koszul algebra as a generalization of $N$-Koszul algebras. We also exhibit examples and we provide a minimal graded projective resolution of the algebra $A$ considered as an $A$-bimodule, which allows us to compute the Hochschild homology groups for some examples of $(a,b)$-Koszul algebras. A weakly Einstein manifold is a generalization of a 4-dimensional Einstein manifold, which is defined as an application of a curvature identity derived from the generalized Gauss-Bonnet formula for a 4-dimensional compact oriented Riemannian manifold. In this paper, we shall give a characterization of a weakly Einstein manifold. We provide a short proof that a 5-connected nonplanar apex graph contains a subdivided $K_{_5}$ or a $K^-_{_4}$ (= $K_{_4}$ with a single edge removed) as a subgraph. Together with a recent result of Ma and Yu that {\\\\sl every nonplanar 5-connected graph containing $K^-_{_4}$ as a subgraph has a subdivided $K_{_5}$}; this settles the Kelmans-Seymour conjecture for apex graphs. Let \\\\cal A be a family of subsets of an n-set such that \\\\cal A does not contain distinct sets A and B with |A\\\\B| = 2|B\\\\A|. How large can \\\\cal A be? Our aim in this note is to determine the maximum size of such an \\\\cal A. This answers a question of Kalai. We also give some related results and conjectures. For a finite group $G$, a semi-Mackey (resp. Tambara) functor is regarded as a $G$-bivariant analog of a commutative monoid (resp. ring). As such, some naive algebraic constructions are generalized to this $G$-bivariant setting. In this article, as a $G$-bivariant analog of the fraction of a ring, we consider {\\\\it fraction} of a Tambara (and a semi-Mackey) functor, by a multiplicative semi-Mackey subfunctor. Let A be an abelian group, B a subgroup of A and let M be an A-module. We show that if A/B is finite, l-torsion and M is a Z[1/l]-module, then the natural maps H_n(A, M_B)--> H_n(A,M_A), H^n(A, M^A)--> H^n(A,M^B) are isomorphism. We use these isomorphisms to study the homology and cohomology of special linear groups. We show that PT-symmetry may exist only for isolated frequencies in optical systems. Therefore, PT-symmetry breaking transitions as the frequency is tuned up, discussed in Y. D. Chong, L. Ge, and A. D. Stone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 093902 (2011), cannot be observed in measurements of the spectrum of scattered intensity. Let $f$ be a continuous endomorphism of a surface $M$, and $A$ an attracting set such that the restriction $f|_A: A \\\\to A$ is a $d:1$ covering map. We show that if $f$ is a local homeomorphism in the immediate basin $B^0_A$ of $A$, then $f$ is also a $d:1$ covering of $B^0_A$. Let A be a connected graded noncommutative monomial algebra. We associate to A a finite graph \\\\Gamma(A) called the CPS graph of A. Finiteness properties of the Yoneda algebra Ext_A(k,k) including Noetherianity, finite GK dimension, and finite generation are characterized in terms of \\\\Gamma(A). We show these properties, notably finite generation, can be checked by means of a terminating algorithm. Given an algebra A, presented by generators and relations, i.e. as a quotient of a tensor algebra by an ideal, we construct a free algebra resolution of A, i.e. a differential graded algebra which is quasi-isomorphic to A and which is itself a tensor algebra. The construction rests combinatorially on the set of bracketings that arise naturally in the description of a free contractible differential graded algebra with given generators. We address the (pointed) homotopy theory of 2-crossed modules (of groups), which are known to faithfully represent Gray 3-groupoids, with a single object, and also connected homotopy 3-types. The homotopy relation between 2-crossed module maps will be defined in a similar way to Crans\\' 1-transfors between strict Gray functors, however being pointed, thus this corresponds to Baues\\' homotopy relation between quadratic module maps. Despite the fact that this homotopy relation between 2-crossed module morphisms is not, in general, an equivalence relation, we prove that if $A$ and $A\\'$ are 2-crossed modules, with the underlying group $F$ of $A$ being free (in short $A$ is free up to order one), then homotopy between 2-crossed module maps $A \\\\to A\\'$ yields, in this case, an equivalence relation. Furthermore, if a chosen basis $B$ is specified for $F$, then we can define a 2-groupoid $HOM_B(A,A\\')$ of 2-crossed module maps $A \\\\to A\\'$, homotopies connecting them, and 2-fold homotopies between homotopies, where the latter correspond to (pointed) Crans\\' 2-transfors between 1-transfors. We define a partial resolution $Q^1(A)$, for a 2-crossed module $A$, whose underlying group is free, with a canonical chosen basis, together with a projection map ${\\\\rm proj}\\\\colon Q^1(A) \\\\to A$, defining isomorphisms at the level of 2-crossed module homotopy groups. This resolution (which is part of a comonad) leads to a weaker notion of homotopy (lax homotopy) between 2-crossed module maps, which we fully develop and describe. In particular, given 2-crossed modules $A$ and $A\\'$, there exists a 2-groupoid ${HOM}_{\\\\rm LAX}(A,A\\')$ of (strict) 2-crossed module maps $A \\\\to A\\'$, and their lax homotopies and lax 2-fold homotopies. The associated notion of a (strict) 2-crossed module map $f\\\\colon A \\\\to A\\'$ to be a lax homotopy equivalence has the two-of-three property, and it is closed under retracts. For a finite group $G$, a Tambara functor on $G$ is regarded as a $G$-bivariant analog of a commutative ring. In this analogy, previously we have defined an ideal of a Tambara functor. In this article, we will demonstrate a calculation of the prime spectrum of the Burnside Tambara functor, when $G$ is a cyclic $p$-group for a prime integer $p$. The goal of this paper is to present a centrality measurement for the nodes of a hypergraph, by using existing literature which extends eigenvector centrality from a graph to a hypergraph, and literature which give a general centrality measurement for a graph. We will use this measurement to say more about the number of communications in a hypergraph, to implement a learning mechanism, and to construct certain networks. We study how regularity along a submanifold of a differential or microdifferential system can propagate from a family of submanifolds to another. The first result is that a microdifferential system regular along a lagrangian foliation is regular. However, when restricted to a fixed submanifold the corresponding result is true only under a condition on the characteristic variety. A dual Banach algebra is a Banach algebra which is a dual space, with the multiplication being separately weak$^*$-continuous. We show that given a unital dual Banach algebra $\\\\mc A$, we can find a reflexive Banach space $E$, and an isometric, weak$^*$-weak$^*$-continuous homomorphism $\\\\pi:\\\\mc A\\\\to\\\\mc B(E)$ such that $\\\\pi(\\\\mc A)$ equals its own bicommutant. A new idea for a binary clock is presented. It displays the time using a triangular array of 15 bits. It is shown that such a geometric, triangular arrangement is only possible because our system of time divisions is based on a sexagesimal system in which the number of minutes in 12 hours equals the factorial of a natural number (720=6!). Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space over a field $\\\\mathrm{k}$ of characteristic $0$. Let $A$ be a linear mapping of $V$ into itself. This paper gives a normal form for $A$, which gives a better description of the structure of $A$ than the companion matrix. The computation of this normal form uses only operations from $\\\\mathrm{k}$ and does not require finding roots of any polynomial. Collision of equilibria with a splitting manifold has been locally studied, but might also be a contributing factor to global bifurcations. In particular a boundary collision can be coincident with collision of a virtual equilibrium with a periodic orbit, giving an analogue to a homoclinic bifurcation. This type of bifurcation is demonstrated in a nonsmooth climate application. Here we describe the nonsmooth bifurcation structure, as well as the smooth bifurcation structure for which the nonsmooth homoclinic bifurcation is a limiting case. We show that, for a finite set $A$ of real numbers, the size of the set $$\\\\frac{A+A}{A+A} = \\\\left\\\\{ \\\\frac{a+b}{c+d} : a,b,c,d \\\\in A, c+d \\\\neq 0 \\\\right \\\\}$$ is bounded from below by $$\\\\left|\\\\frac{A+A}{A+A} \\\\right| \\\\gg \\\\frac{|A|^{2+1/4}}{|A / A|^{1/8} \\\\log |A|}.$$ This improves a result of Roche-Newton. This paper studies the viability of making a country a developmental state. In particular it studies the characteristics of a developmental state and how they are linked to technology. It then identifies technical education, as a vital force for the creation of a developmental state. In particular it identifies analytical, numeracy, computational and communication skills as vital forces for a society to create a developmental society. A set of reals $A=\\\\{a_1,...,a_n\\\\}$ labeled in increasing order is called convex if there exists a continuous strictly convex function $f$ such that $f(i)=a_i$ for every $i$. Given a convex set $A$, we prove \\\\[|A+A|\\\\gg\\\\frac{|A|^{14/9}}{(\\\\log|A|)^{2/9}}.\\\\] Sumsets of different summands and an application to a sum-product-type problem are also studied either as remarks or as theorems. A quantum simulation of a travelling salesman is described. A vector space for a graph is defined together with a sequence of operators which transform a special initial state into a superposition states representing Hamiltonian tours. The quantum amplitude for any tour is a function of the classical cost of travelling along the edges in that tour. Tours with the largest quantum amplitude may be different than those with the smallest classically-computed cost. A subcategory $\\\\textbf{C}$ of a groupoid $\\\\mathbb{G}$ is a left order in $\\\\mathbb{G}$, if every element of $\\\\mathbb{G}$ can be written as $a^{-1}b$ where $a, b \\\\in \\\\textbf{C}$. A subsemigroupoid $\\\\mathfrak{C}$ of a groupoid $\\\\mathbb{G}$ is a left q-order in $\\\\mathbb{G}$, if every element of $\\\\mathbb{G}$ can be written as $a^{-1}b$ where $a, b \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{C}$. We give a characterization of left orders (q-orders) in groupoids. In addition, we describe the relationship between left I-orders in primitive inverse semigroups and left orders (q-orders) in groupoids. We define the scattered subsets of a group as asymptotic counterparts of scattered subspaces of a topological space, and prove that a subset $A$ of a group $G$ is scattered if and only if $A$ contains no piecewise shifted $IP$-subsets. For an amenable group $G$ and a scattered subspace $A$ of $G$, we show that $\\\\mu(A)=0$ for each left invariant Banach measure $\\\\mu$ on $G$. We show that for spaces $A$ that satisfy a certain smallness condition, there is a Lawvere theory $T_A$ so that a space $X$ has the structure of a $T_A$-algebra if and only if $X$ is weakly equivalent to a mapping space out of $A$. In particular, spheres localized at a set of primes satisfy this condition. Let $A$ be a Nakayama algebra. We give a description of the singularity category of $A$ inside its stable module category. We prove that there is a duality between the singularity category of $A$ and the singularity category of its opposite algebra. As a consequence, the resolution quiver of $A$ and the resolution quiver of its opposite algebra have the same number of cycles and the same number of cyclic vertices. A novel canonical transformation is offered as the mean for studying properties of a system of strongly correlated electrons. As an example of the utility of the transformation, it is used to demonstrate the existence of a quantum phase transition in a Hubbard model on a square lattice. An Appendix presents two cases with a negative result. Finding a hidden partition in a random environment is a general and important problem, which contains as subproblems many famous questions, such as finding a hidden clique, finding a hidden coloring, finding a hidden bipartition etc. In this paper, we provide a simple SVD algorithm for this purpose, answering a question of McSherry. This algorithm is very easy to implement and works for sparse graphs with optimal density. The paper considers a continuous-time birth-death process where the jump rate has an asymptotically polynomial dependence on the process position. We obtain a rough exponential asymptotics for the probability of excursions of a re-scaled process contained within a neighborhood of a given continuous non-negative function. In this paper, we introduce a strong property $(A)$ and we study the transfer of property $(A)$ and strong property $(A)$ in trivial ring extensions and amalgamated duplication of a ring along an ideal. We also exhibit a class of rings which satisfy property $(A)$ and do not satisfy strong property $(A)$. Let $A\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb C$ be a starlike set with a center $a$. We prove that every tangent space to $A$ at the point $a$ is isometric to the smallest closed cone, with the vertex $a$, which includes $A$. A partial converse to this result is obtained. The tangent space to convex sets is also discussed. We study the asymptotic behaviour of occupation times of a transient random walk in quenched random environment on a strip in a sub-diffusive regime. The asymptotic behaviour of hitting times, which is a more traditional object of study, is the exactly same. As a particular case, we solve a long standing problem of describing the asymptotic behaviour of a random walk with bounded jumps on a one-dimensional lattice The objective of this research paper is to study the relationship between a block of a finite group and a defect group of such block. We define a new notion which is called a strongly $k(D)$-block and give a necessary and sufficient condition of a block with a cyclic defect group to be a $k(D)$-block in term of its inertial index. A holonomic D-module on a complex analytic manifoldadmits always a b-function along any submanifold. If the module is regular, itadmits also a regular b-function, that is a b-function with a condition on the order of the lower terms of the equation.There is a weaker condition of regularity: regularity alonga submanifold. We prove that a module which is regular alonga submanifold admits a regular b-function along this submanifold. Let $F$ be an algebraically closed field. We show that if a quantum formal deformation $A$ of a commutative domain $A_0$ over $F$ is a PI algebra, then $A$ is commutative if ${\\\\rm char}(F)=0$, and has PI degree a power of $p$ if ${\\\\rm char}(F)=p>0$. This implies the same result for filtered deformations (i.e., filtered algebras $A$ such that ${\\\\rm gr}(A)=A_0$). For a Banach space $X$, a sequence of Banach spaces $(Y_n)$, and a Banach space $Z$ with an unconditional basis, D. Alspach and B. Sari introduced a generalization of a Bourgain tree called a $(\\\\oplus_n Y_n)_Z$-tree in $X$. These authors also prove that any separable Banach space admitting a $(\\\\oplus_n Y_n)_Z$-tree with order $\\\\omega_1$ admits a subspace isomorphic to $(\\\\oplus_n Y_n)_Z$. In this paper we give two new proofs of this result. Let $C/\\\\mathbb{F}_q$ be a regular projective curve, $\\\\infty \\\\in C$ a closed point, $A := \\\\Gamma(C - \\\\{\\\\infty\\\\}, \\\\mathcal{O}_C)$, and $K := K(C)$ the fraction field of $A$. Consider a finite extension $L/K$, a place $v$ of $L$, and an abelian $A$-module $M$ (in the sense of Anderson) over $L_v$. We prove that the $L_v$-rational torsion submodule $M(L_v)_{\\\\mathrm{tors}}$ of $M$ is a finite $A$-module. We prove that every weak-local triple derivation on a JB$^*$-triple $E$ (i.e. a linear map $T: E\\\\to E$ such that for each $\\\\phi \\\\in E^*$ and each $a\\\\in E$, there exists a triple derivation $\\\\delta_{a,\\\\phi} : E\\\\to E$, depending on $\\\\phi$ and $a$, such that $\\\\phi T(a) = \\\\phi \\\\delta_{a,\\\\phi} (a)$) is a (continuous) triple derivation. A $\\\\overrightarrow{P_{3}}$-decomposition of a directed graph $D$ is a partition of the arcs of $D$ into directed paths of length $2$. In this paper, we give a characterization for a tournament and a bipartite digraph admitting a $\\\\overrightarrow{P_{3}}$-decomposition. This solves a problem posed by Diwan ($\\\\overrightarrow{P_{3}}$-decomposition of directed graphs, Discrete Appl. Math., http:// dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2016.01.039.). The paper uses a non-cooperative simultaneous game for coalition structure formation (Levando, 2016) to demonstrate some applications of the introduced game: a cooperation, a Bayesian game within a coalition with intra-coalition externalities, a stochastic game, where states are coalition structures; self-enforcement properties of a non-cooperative equilibrium and a construction of a non-cooperative stability criterion. Using a non-Laver modification of Uri Abraham\\'s minimal $\\\\varDelta^1_3$ collapse function, we define a generic extension $L[a]$ by a real $a$, in which, for a given $n\\\\ge3$, $\\\\{a\\\\}$ is a lightface $\\\\varPi^1_n$ singleton, $a$ effectively codes a cofinal map $\\\\omega\\\\to\\\\omega_1^L$ minimal over $L$, while every $\\\\varSigma^1_n$ set $X\\\\subseteq\\\\omega$ is still constructible. In this paper, we consider a system of a massless Klein-Gordon field coupled to a static source. The total Hamiltonian is a self-adjoint operator on a boson Fock space. We consider annihilation operators in the Heisenberg picture and define a sesquilinear form. Under infrared regularity conditions, it is proven that the sesquilinear form is a solution of the classical field equation. A line pattern in a free group $F$ is defined by a malnormal collection of cyclic subgroups. Otal defined a decomposition space $\\\\mathcal{D}$ associated to a line pattern. We provide an algorithm that computes a presentation for the \\\\v{C}ech cohomology of $\\\\mathcal{D}$, thought of as a $F$-module. This answers a relative version of a question of Epstein about boundaries of hyperbolic groups. Let $\\\\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field of order $q$, where $q$ is a power of a prime. For a set $A \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{F}_q$, under certain structural restrictions, we prove a new explicit lower bound on the size of the product set $A(A + 1)$. Our result improves on the previous best known bound due to Zhelezov and holds under more relaxed restrictions. We show that the free Banach lattice $\\\\mathrm{FBL}(A)$ may be constructed as the completion of $\\\\mathrm{FVL}(A)$ with respect to the maximal lattice seminorm $\\\\nu$ on $\\\\mathrm{FVL}(A)$ with $\\\\nu(a)\\\\le 1$ for all $a\\\\in A$. We present a similar construction for the free Banach lattice $\\\\mathrm{FBL}[E]$ generated by a Banach space $E$. For an arbitrary group $G$ and arbitrary set $A$, we define a monoid structure on the set of all uniformly continuous functions $A^G\\\\to A$ and then we show that it is naturally isomorphic to the monoid of cellular automata $\\\\mathrm{CA}(G, A)$. This gives a new equivalent definition of a cellular automaton over the group $G$ with alphabet set $A$. We use this new interpretation to give a simple proof of the theorem of Curtis-Hedlund. We give a simple and a more explicit proof of a mod $4$ congruence for a series involving the little $q$-Jacobi polynomials which arose in a recent study of a certain restricted overpartition function. Let $A$ be a truncated quiver algebra over an algebraically closed field such that any oriented cycle in the ordinary quiver of $A$ is zero in $A$. We give the number of the indecomposable direct summands of the middle term of an almost split sequence for a class of Hochschild extension algebras of $A$ by the standard duality module $D(A)$. In this article we study mutation of friezes of type $D$. We provide a combinatorial formula for the entries in a frieze after mutation. The two main ingredients in the proof include a certain transformation of a type $D$ frieze into a sub pattern of a frieze of type $A$ and the mutation formula for type $A$ friezes recently found by Baur et al. Let $D$ be an invertible multiplication operator on $L^2(X, \\\\mu)$, and let $A$ be a bounded operator on $L^2(X, \\\\mu)$. In this note we prove that $\\\\|A\\\\|^2 \\\\le \\\\|D A\\\\| \\\\, \\\\|D^{-1} A\\\\|$, where $\\\\|\\\\cdot\\\\|$ denotes the operator norm. If, in addition, the operators $A$ and $D$ are positive, we also have $w(A)^2 \\\\le w(D A) \\\\, w(D^{-1} A)$, where $w$ denotes the numerical radius. Here we prove the following result. Let $A = \\\\{a_{ij}\\\\}_{i,j\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}}$ be a bounded operator. Then there exists a signing of $A$ such that $$||A\\\\circ S||_2 < 2||A||_{l_\\\\infty(l_2)},$$ where $A\\\\circ S$ denotes the matrix generated by the entry-wise product of $A$ and $S$. A hypergroup is stringent if $a \\\\boxplus b$ is a singleton whenever $a \\\\neq -b$. A hyperfield is stringent if the underlying additive hypergroup is. Every doubly distributive skew hyperfield is stringent, but not vice versa. We present a classification of stringent hypergroups, from which a classification of doubly distributive skew hyperfields follows. It follows from our classification that every such hyperfield is a quotient of a field. Let $D$ be a bounded convex domain in $\\\\mathbb{C}$ with a regular analytic boundary. Suppose that the numerical range $W(A)$ of a bounded linear operator $A$ is contained in $\\\\overline{D}$. If $\\\\overline{W(A)}$ intersects the boundary $\\\\partial D$ at infinitely many points while the essential numerical range $W_\\\\text{ess}(A)$ does not intersect $\\\\partial D$, then $W(A) = \\\\overline{D}$. This generalizes some infinite dimensional analogues of a result of Anderson. In this paper we\\'re considering the question of whether or not a partial order on a finite set is realisable as a Smale order of a structurally stable diffeomorphism or flow acting on a closed manifold. We classify the orders that are realisable by 1) an $\\\\Omega$-stable diffeomorphism acting on a closed surface 2) an Anosov flow on a closed 3-manifold 3) a stable diffeomorphism with trivial attractors and repellers acting on a closed surface. A truncated Toeplitz operator is the compression of a classical Toeplitz operator on the Hardy space to a model space. A truncated Hankel operator is the compression of a Hankel operator on the Hardy space to the orthogonal complement of a model space. We study the product of a truncated Hankel operator and a truncated Toeplitz operator, and characterize when such a product is zero or compact. Given a standard graded polynomial ring over a commutative Noetherian ring $A$, we prove that the cohomological dimension and the height of the ideals defining any of its Veronese subrings are equal. This result is due to Ogus when $A$ is a field of characteristic zero, and follows from a result of Peskine and Szpiro when $A$ is a field of positive characteristic; our result applies, for example, when $A$ is the ring of integers. We present a derivation of the exact sign-time distribution for a random walker in the presence of a boundary moving with constant velocity. For a large class of statistical systems a geometric mean value of the observables is constrained. These observables are characterized by a power-law statistical distribution. We show that the Woronowicz prescription using a bimodule constructed out of a tensorial product of a bimodule and its conjugate and a bi-coinvariant singlet leads to a trivial differential calculus. We show that the zeta function of a regular graph admits a representation as a quotient of a determinant over a $L^2$-determinant of the combinatorial Laplacian. We give a criterium of holomorphy for some type formal power series. This gives a stronger form of a Rothstein\\'s type extension theorem for a particular ring of holomorphic functions. Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A means a weak structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B contained in A which is embedded with a stronger structure S. These types of structures occur in our everyday\\'s life, that\\'s why we study them in this book. Thus, as a particular case: A non-associative ring is a non-empty set R together with two binary operations \\'+\\' and \\'.\\' such that (R, +) is an additive abelian group and (R, .) is a groupoid. For all a, b, c belonging to R we have (a + b) . c = a . c + b . c and c . (a + b) = c . a + c . b. A Smarandache non-associative ring is a non-associative ring (R, +, .) which has a proper subset P contained in R, that is an associative ring (with respect to the same binary operations on R). A `right-sided, nearest neighbour cellular automaton\\' (RNNCA) is a continuous transformation F:A^Z-->A^Z determined by a local rule f:A^{0,1}-->A so that, for any a in A^Z and any z in Z, F(a)_z = f(a_{z},a_{z+1}) . We say that F is `bipermutative\\' if, for any choice of a in A, the map g:A-->A defined by g(b) = f(a,b) is bijective, and also, for any choice of b in A, the map h:A-->A defined by h(a)=f(a,b) is bijective. We characterize the invariant measures of bipermutative RNNCA. First we introduce the equivalent notion of a `quasigroup CA\\', to expedite the construction of examples. Then we characterize F-invariant measures when A is a (nonabelian) group, and f(a,b) = a*b. Then we show that, if F is any bipermutative RNNCA, and mu is F-invariant, then F must be mu-almost everywhere K-to-1, for some constant K . We use this to characterize invariant measures when A^Z is a `group shift\\' and F is an `endomorphic CA\\'. We prove that the integral closure of a Poisson algebra $A$ over a field of characteristic 0 is again a Poisson algebra. Galois comodules of a coring are studied. The conditions for a simple comodule to be a Galois comodule are found. A special class of Galois comodules termed principal comodules is introduced. These are defined as Galois comodules that are projective over their comodule endomorphism rings. A complete description of principal comodules in the case a background ring is a field is found. In particular it is shown that a (finitely generated and projective) right comodule of an $A$-coring $\\\\mathcal C$ is principal provided a lifting of the canonical map is a split epimorphism in the category of left $\\\\mathcal C$-comodules. This description is then used to characterise principal extensions or non-commutative principal bundles. Specifically, it is proven that, over a field, any entwining structure consisting of an algebra $A$, a coseparable coalgebra $C$ and a bijective entwining map $\\\\psi$ together with a group-like element in $C$ give rise to a principal extension provided the lifted canonical map is surjective. Induction of Galois and principal comodules via morphisms of corings is described. A connection between the relative injectivity of a Galois comodule and the properties of the extension of endomorphism rings associated to this comodule is revealed. Given a C*-algebra B, a closed *-subalgebra A contained in B, and a partial isometry S in B which \"interacts\" with A in the sense that S*aS = H(a)S*S and SaS* = V(a)SS*, where V and H are positive linear operators on A, we derive a few properties which V and H are forced to satisfy. Removing B and S from the picture we define an \"interaction\" as being a pair of maps (V,H) satisfying the derived properties. Starting with an abstract interaction (V,H) over a C*-algebra A we construct a C*-algebra B containing A and a partial isometry S whose \"interaction\" with A follows the above rules. We then discuss the possibility of constructing a \"covariance algebra\" from an interaction. This turns out to require a generalization of the notion of correspondences (also known as Pimsner bimodules) which we call a \"generalized correspondence\". Such an object should be seen as an usual correspondence, except that the inner-products need not lie in the coefficient algebra. The covariance algebra is then defined using a natural generalization of Pimsner\\'s construction of the celebrated Cuntz-Pimsner algebras. A Hereditarily Indecomposable asymptotic $\\\\ell_2$ Banach space is constructed. The existence of such a space answers a question of B. Maurey and verifies a conjecture of W.T. Gowers. The aim of this paper is to give a recursive formula to multiply a line bundle with the structure sheaf of a schubert variety in the equivariant $K$-theory of a flag variety. Let $X$ be a compact metric space and let $\\\\af$ be a homeomorphism on $X.$ Related to a theorem of Pimsner, we show that $C(X)\\\\rtimes_{\\\\af}\\\\Z$ can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra if and only if there is a strictly positive $\\\\af$-invariant Borel probability measure. Suppose that $\\\\Lambda$ is a $\\\\Z^d$ action on $X.$ If $C(X)\\\\rtimes_{\\\\Lambda}\\\\Z$ can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra, then there must exist a strictly positive $\\\\Lambda$-invariant Borel probability measure. We show that, if in addition, there is a generator $\\\\af_1$ of $\\\\Lambda$ such that $(X, \\\\af_1)$ is minimal and unique ergodic, then $C(X)\\\\rtimes_{\\\\Lambda}\\\\Z^d$ can be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra with a unique tracial state. Let $A$ be a unital separable amenable simple \\\\CA with tracial rank zero and with a unique tracial state which satisfies the Universal Coefficient Theorem and let $G$ be a finitely generated discrete abelian group. Suppose $\\\\Lambda: G\\\\to Aut(A)$ is a \\\\hm. Then $A\\\\rtimes_{\\\\Lambda} G$ can always be embedded into a unital simple AF-algebra. We present a quantum public-key cryptosystem based on a classical NP-complete problem related with finding a code word of a given weight in a linear binary code. We give a simpler proof of a result of Holland concerning a mixed arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also prove a result of mixed mean inequality involving the symmetric means. We give criteria for correct solvability in L_p(R) of a general Sturm-Liouville equation Let $A$ be a unital separable simple infinite dimensional \\\\CA with tracial rank no more than one and with the tracial state space $T(A)$ and let $U(A)$ be the unitary group of $A.$ Suppose that $u\\\\in U_0(A),$ the connected component of $U(A)$ containing the identity. We show that, for any $\\\\ep>0,$ there exists a selfadjoint element $h\\\\in A_{s.a}$ such that $$ \\\\|u-\\\\exp(ih)\\\\|<\\\\ep. $$ We also study the problem when $u$ can be approximated by unitaries in $A$ with finite spectrum. Denote by $CU(A)$ the closure of the subgroup of unitary group of $U(A)$ generated by its commutators. It is known that $CU(A)\\\\subset U_0(A).$ Denote by $\\\\widehat{a}$ the affine function on $T(A)$ defined by $\\\\widehat{a}(\\\\tau)=\\\\tau(a).$ We show that $u$ can be approximated by unitaries in $A$ with finite spectrum if and only if $u\\\\in CU(A)$ and $\\\\widehat{u^n+(u^n)^*},i(\\\\widehat{u^n-(u^n)^*})\\\\in \\\\overline{\\\\rho_A(K_0(A)}$ for all $n\\\\ge 1.$ Examples are given that there are unitaries in $CU(A)$ which can not be approximated by unitaries with finite spectrum. Significantly these results are obtained in the absence of amenability. We investigate the higher-dimensional amenability of tensor products $\\\\A \\\\ptp \\\\B$ of Banach algebras $\\\\A$ and $\\\\B$. We prove that the weak bidimension $db_w$ of the tensor product $\\\\A \\\\ptp \\\\B$ of Banach algebras $\\\\A$ and $\\\\B$ with bounded approximate identities satisfies \\\\[ db_w \\\\A \\\\ptp \\\\B = db_w \\\\A + db_w \\\\B. \\\\] We show that it cannot be extended to arbitrary Banach algebras. For example, for a biflat Banach algebra $\\\\A$ which has a left or right, but not two-sided, bounded approximate identity, we have $db_w \\\\A \\\\ptp \\\\A \\\\le 1$ and $db_w \\\\A + db_w \\\\A =2.$ We describe explicitly the continuous Hochschild cohomology $\\\\H^n(\\\\A \\\\ptp \\\\B, (X \\\\ptp Y)^*)$ and the cyclic cohomology $\\\\H\\\\C^n(\\\\A \\\\ptp \\\\B)$ of certain tensor products $\\\\A \\\\ptp \\\\B$ of Banach algebras $\\\\A$ and $\\\\B$ with bounded approximate identities; here $(X \\\\ptp Y)^*$ is the dual bimodule of the tensor product of essential Banach bimodules $X$ and $Y$ over $\\\\A$ and $\\\\B$ respectively. We define a category $\\\\galt$ of g-alternative algebras over a field $F$ and present the category of alternative algebras $\\\\alt$ as a full subcategory of $\\\\galt$; in the case $\\\\ch F\\\\neq 2$, we have $\\\\alt=\\\\galt$. For any g-alternative algebra $A$ we give a construction of a universal strict general actor $\\\\cB(A)$ of $A$. We define the subset $\\\\asoci(A)$ of $A$, and show that it is a $\\\\cB(A)$-substructure of $A$. We prove that if $\\\\asoci(A)=0$, then there exists an actor of $A$ in $\\\\galt$ and $\\\\act(A)=\\\\cB(A)$. In particular, we obtain that if $A$ is anticommutative and $\\\\ann(A)=0$, then there exists an actor of $A$ in $\\\\galt$; from this, under the same conditions, we deduce the existence of an actor in $\\\\alt$. In this paper, building on prior joint work by Mallios and Ntumba, we show that $\\\\mathcal A$-\\\\textit{transvections} and \\\\textit{singular symplectic }$\\\\mathcal A$-\\\\textit{automorphisms} of symplectic $\\\\mathcal A$-modules of finite rank have properties similar to the ones enjoyed by their classical counterparts. The characterization of singular symplectic $\\\\mathcal A$-automorphisms of symplectic $\\\\mathcal A$-modules of finite rank is grounded on a newly introduced class of pairings of $\\\\mathcal A$-modules: the \\\\textit{orthogonally convenient pairings.} We also show that, given a symplectic $\\\\mathcal A$-module $\\\\mathcal E$ of finite rank, with $\\\\mathcal A$ a \\\\textit{PID-algebra sheaf}, any injective $\\\\mathcal A$-morphism of a \\\\textit{Lagrangian sub-$\\\\mathcal A$-module} $\\\\mathcal F$ of $\\\\mathcal E$ into $\\\\mathcal E$ may be extended to an $\\\\mathcal A$-symplectomorphism of $\\\\mathcal E$ such that its restriction on $\\\\mathcal F$ equals the identity of $\\\\mathcal F$. This result also holds in the more general case whereby the underlying free $\\\\mathcal A$-module $\\\\mathcal E$ is equipped with two symplectic $\\\\mathcal A$-structures $\\\\omega_0$ and $\\\\omega_1$, but with $\\\\mathcal F$ being Lagrangian with respect to both $\\\\omega_0$ and $\\\\omega_1$. The latter is the analog of the classical \\\\textit{Witt\\'s theorem} for symplectic $\\\\mathcal A$-modules of finite rank. We continue the study of the lower central series L_i(A) and its successive quotients B_i(A) of a noncommutative associative algebra A, defined by L_1(A)=A, L_{i+1}(A)=[A,L_i(A)], and B_i(A)=L_i(A)/L_{i+1}(A). We describe B_{2}(A) for A a quotient of the free algebra on two or three generators by the two-sided ideal generated by a generic homogeneous element. We prove that it is isomorphic to a certain quotient of Kaehler differentials on the non-smooth variety associated to the abelianization of A. If we take into account the Hilbertian gravitational repulsion, even a dust sphere with a zero fluido-dynamical pressure collapses to a body of a comparatively small, finite, volume. We prove that there exists a rank one perturbation of a unitary operator on a complex separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space which is hypercyclic. A linear time algorithm to find a set of nearest elements in a mesh. I comment on a recent preprint \"Neutrino Velocity Anomalies: A Resolution without a Revolution\" that appeared recently as arXiv:1110.0989 [hep-ph] In 1948 A. Horn and A. Tarski asked whether the notions of a \\\\sigma-finite cc and a \\\\sigma-bounded cc ordering are equivalent. We give a negative answer to this question. A reconstruction of a function from integrals over the family of confocal paraboloids is given by a FBP formula. What is the minimal cardinal of a family which shatters all d-subsets of a finite set? We consider the problem of finding quasiperiodicities in a Fibonacci string. A factor u of a string y is a cover of y if every letter of y falls within some occurrence of u in y. A string v is a seed of y, if it is a cover of a superstring of y. A left seed of a string y is a prefix of y that it is a cover of a superstring of y. Similarly a right seed of a string y is a suffix of y that it is a cover of a superstring of y. In this paper, we present some interesting results regarding quasiperiodicities in Fibonacci strings, we identify all covers, left/right seeds and seeds of a Fibonacci string and all covers of a circular Fibonacci string. In this paper we find all symplectic groups and their maximal tori in which normalizer of a torus is split over the torus. Let $K$ denote a field, and let $V$ denote a vector space over $K$ with finite positive dimension. We consider a pair of linear transformations $A:V \\\\to V$ and $A^*: V \\\\to V$ that satisfy (i), (ii) below: (i) There exists a basis for $V$ with respect to which the matrix representing $A$ is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing $A^*$ is diagonal. (ii) There exists a basis for $V$ with respect to which the matrix representing $A^*$ is irreducible tridiagonal and the matrix representing $A$ is diagonal. We call such a pair a {\\\\em Leonard pair} on $V$. In this paper we investigate the commutator $AA^*-A^*A$. Our results are as follows. First assume the dimension of $V$ is even. We show $AA^*-A^*A$ is invertible and display several attractive formulae for the determinant. Next assume the dimension of $V$ is odd. We show that the null space of $AA^*-A^*A$ has dimension 1. We display a nonzero vector in this null space. We express this vector as a sum of eigenvectors for $A$ and as a sum of eigenvectors for $A^*$. Approximate message passing (AMP) and its variants, developed based on loopy belief propagation, are attractive for estimating a vector x from a noisy version of z = Ax, which arises in many applications. For a large A with i. i. d. elements, AMP can be characterized by the state evolution and exhibits fast convergence. However, it has been shown that, AMP mayeasily diverge for a generic A. In this work, we develop a new variant of AMP based on a unitary transformation of the original model (hence the variant is called UT-AMP), where the unitary matrix is available for any matrix A, e.g., the conjugate transpose of the left singular matrix of A, or a normalized DFT (discrete Fourier transform) matrix for any circulant A. We prove that, in the case of Gaussian priors, UT-AMP always converges for any matrix A. It is observed that UT-AMP is much more robust than the original AMP for difficult A and exhibits fast convergence. A special form of UT-AMP with a circulant A was used in our previous work [13] for turbo equalization. This work extends it to a generic A, and provides a theoretical investigation on the convergence. We study the question when a $*$-autonomous Mix-category has a representation as a $*$-autonomous Mix-subcategory of a compact one. We define certain partial trace-like operation on morphisms of a Mix-category, which we call a mixed trace, and show that any structure preserving embedding of a Mix-category into a compact one induces a mixed trace on the former. We also show that, conversely, if a Mix-category ${\\\\bf K}$ has a mixed trace, then we can construct a compact category and structure preserving embedding of ${\\\\bf K}$ into it, which induces the same mixed trace. Finally, we find a specific condition expressed in terms of interaction of Mix- and coevaluation maps on a Mix-category ${\\\\bf K}$, which is necessary and sufficient for a structure preserving embedding of ${\\\\bf K}$ into a compact one to exist. When this condition is satisfied, we construct a \"free\" or \"minimal\" mixed trace on ${\\\\bf K}$ directly from the Mix-category structure, which gives us also a \"free\" compactification of ${\\\\bf K}$. We briefly present a new construction of a 3-to-1 unrecoverable electrical network. This is a taste of a comprehensive forthcoming paper on unrecoverable electrical networks. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for the topological equivalence of a continuous function on a plane to a projection onto one of coordinates. Let R be a commutative Noetherian ring, a a proper ideal of R and M a finite R-module. It is shown that, if (R;m) is a complete local ring, then under certain conditions a contains a regular element on DR(Hc a(M)), where c = cd(a;M). A non-zerodivisor characterization of relative Cohen-Macaulay modules w.r.t a is given. We introduce the concept of relative Cohen-Macaulay filtered modules w.r.t a and study some basic properties of such modules. In paticular, we provide a non-zerodivisor characterization of relative Cohen-Macaulay filtered modules w.r.t a. Furthermore, a characterization of cohomological dimension filtration of M by the associated prime ideals of its factors is established. As a consequence, we present a cohomological dimension filtration for those modules whose zero submodule has a primary decomposition. Finally, we bring some new results about relative Cohen- Macaulay modules w.r.t a. For a subset A of a finite abelian group G we define Sigma(A)={sum_{a\\\\in B}a:B\\\\subset A}. In the case that Sigma(A) has trivial stabiliser, one may deduce that the size of Sigma(A) is at least quadratic in |A|; the bound |Sigma(A)|>= |A|^{2}/64 has recently been obtained by De Vos, Goddyn, Mohar and Samal. We improve this bound to the asymptotically best possible result |Sigma(A)|>= (1/4-o(1))|A|^{2}. We also study a related problem in which A is any subset of Z_{n} with all elements of A coprime to n; it has recently been shown, by Vu, that if such a set A has the property Sigma(A) is not Z_{n} then |A|=O(sqrt{n}). This bound was improved to |A|<= 8sqrt{n} by De Vos, Goddyn, Mohar and Samal, we further improve the bound to the asymptotically best possible result |A|<= (2+o(1))sqrt{n}. A particular case of the level increasing conjecture for type A fusion coefficientes is proved for when one the weights is a multiple of the first fundamental weight. Parseval frames can be thought of as redundant or linearly dependent coordinate systems for Hilbert spaces, and have important applications in such areas as signal processing, data compression, and sampling theory. We extend the notion of a Parseval frame for a fixed Hilbert space to that of a moving Parseval frame for a vector bundle over a manifold. Many vector bundles do not have a moving basis, but in contrast to this every vector bundle over a paracompact manifold has a moving Parseval frame. We prove that a sequence of sections of a vector bundle is a moving Parseval frame if and only if the sections are the orthogonal projection of a moving orthonormal basis for a larger vector bundle. In the case that our vector bundle is the tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold, we prove that a sequence of vector fields is a Parseval frame for the tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold if and only if the vector fields are the orthogonal projection of a moving orthonormal basis for the tangent bundle of a larger Riemannian manifold. The main properties of the crossed product in the category of Hopf algebras are investigated. Let $A$ and $H$ be two Hopf algebras connected by two morphism of coalgebras $\\\\triangleright : H\\\\ot A \\\\to A$, $f:H\\\\ot H\\\\to A$. The crossed product $A #_{f}^{\\\\triangleright} H$ is a new Hopf algebra containing $A$ as a normal Hopf subalgebra. Furthermore, a Hopf algebra $E$ is isomorphic as a Hopf algebra to a crossed product of Hopf algebras $A #_{f}^{\\\\triangleright} H$ if and only if $E$ factorizes through a normal Hopf subalgebra $A$ and a subcoalgebra $H$ such that $1_{E} \\\\in H$. The universality of the construction, the existence of integrals, commutativity or involutivity of the crossed product are studied. Looking at the quantum side of the construction we shall give necessary and sufficient conditions for a crossed product to be a coquasitriangular Hopf algebra. In particular, all braided structures on the monoidal category of $A #_{f}^{\\\\triangleright} H$-comodules are explicitly described in terms of their components. As an example, the braidings on a crossed product between $H_{4}$ and $k[C_{3}]$ are described in detail. A KMS matrix is one of the form $$J_n(a)=[{array}{ccccc} 0 & a & a^2 &... & a^{n-1} & 0 & a & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\ddots & \\\\ddots & a^2 & & & \\\\ddots & a 0 & & & & 0{array}]$$ for $n\\\\ge 1$ and $a$ in $\\\\mathbb{C}$. Among other things, we prove the following properties of its numerical range: (1) $W(J_n(a))$ is a circular disc if and only if $n=2$ and $a\\\\neq 0$, (2) its boundary $\\\\partial W(J_n(a))$ contains a line segment if and only if $n\\\\ge 3$ and $|a|=1$, and (3) the intersection of the boundaries $\\\\partial W(J_n(a))$ and $\\\\partial W(J_n(a)[j])$ is either the singleton $\\\\{\\\\min\\\\sigma(\\\\re J_n(a))\\\\}$ if $n$ is odd, $j=(n+1)/2$ and $|a|>1$, or the empty set $\\\\emptyset$ if otherwise, where, for any $n$-by-$n$ matrix $A$, $A[j]$ denotes its $j$th principal submatrix obtained by deleting its $j$th row and $j$th column ($1\\\\le j\\\\le n$), $\\\\re A$ its real part $(A+A^*)/2$, and $\\\\sigma(A)$ its spectrum. For an $n$-by-$n$ complex matrix $A$, we define its zero-dilation index $d(A)$ as the largest size of a zero matrix which can be dilated to $A$. This is the same as the maximum $k$ ($\\\\ge 1$) for which 0 is in the rank-$k$ numerical range of $A$. Using a result of Li and Sze, we show that if $d(A) > \\\\lfloor 2n/3\\\\rfloor$, then, under unitary similarity, $A$ has the zero matrix of size $3d(A)-2n$ as a direct summand. It complements the known fact that if $d(A)>\\\\lfloor n/2\\\\rfloor$, then 0 is an eigenvalue of $A$. We then use it to give a complete characterization of $n$-by-$n$ matrices $A$ with $d(A)=n-1$, namely, $A$ satisfies this condition if and only if it is unitarily similar to $B\\\\oplus 0_{n-3}$, where $B$ is a 3-by-3 matrix whose numerical range $W(B)$ is an elliptic disc and whose eigenvalue other than the two foci of $\\\\partial W(B)$ is 0. We also determine the value of $d(A)$ for any normal matrix and any weighted permutation matrix $A$. Let $G$, $R$ and $A$ be topological groups. Suppose that $G$ and $R$ act continuously on $A$, and $G$ acts continuously on $R$. In this paper, we define a partially crossed topological $G-R$-bimodule $(A,\\\\mu)$, where $\\\\mu:A\\\\rightarrow R$ is a continuous homomorphism. Let $Der_{c}(G,(A,\\\\mu))$ be the set of all $(\\\\alpha,r)$ such that $\\\\alpha:G\\\\rightarrow A$ is a continuous crossed homomorphism and $\\\\mu\\\\alpha(g)=r^{g}r^{-1}$. We introduce a topology on $Der_{c}(G,(A,\\\\mu))$. We show that $Der_{c}(G,(A,\\\\mu))$ is a topological group, wherever $G$ and $R$ are locally compact. We define the first cohomology, $H^{1}(G,(A,\\\\mu))$, of $G$ with coefficients in $(A,\\\\mu)$ as a quotient space of $Der_{c}(G,(A,\\\\mu))$. Also, we state conditions under which $H^{1}(G,(A,\\\\mu))$ is a topological group. Finally, we show that under what conditions $H^{1}(G,(A,\\\\mu))$ is one of the following: $k$-space, discrete, locally compact and compact. This paper gives a slight refinement of a theorem of Hamilton, which shows that the velocity of a Keplerian motion moves on a circle. We present a construction of a compact connected space which supports a normal probability measure. Hilbert\\'s Satz 90 tells us that for a given cyclic extension $K/k$, a unit of norm $1$ in $K$ can be written as a quotient of conjugate elements in $K$. For the extensions $\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\zeta_p)/\\\\mathbb{Q}$ with $p$ prime $> 3$, Newman proved a refinement of Hilbert\\'s Satz 90 that gives a sufficient and necessary condition for which a unit of norm $1$ in $\\\\mathbb{Q}(\\\\zeta_p)$ can be written as a quotient of conjugate units. In order to obtain this result, Newman proved a stronger result that gives a unique representation of units of norm $1$ as a product of a power of $\\\\dfrac{1 - \\\\zeta_p^e}{1 - \\\\zeta_p}$ with a quotient of conjugate units, where $e$ is a given primitive root modulo $p$. In this paper, we obtain a function field analogue of Newman\\'s result for the $\\\\wp$-th cyclotomic function field extensions $\\\\mathbb{K}_{\\\\wp}/\\\\mathbb{F}_q(T)$, where $\\\\wp$ is a monic prime in $\\\\mathbb{F}_q[T]$. As a consequence, we proved a refinement of Hilbert\\'s Satz 90 for the extensions $\\\\mathbb{K}_{\\\\wp}/\\\\mathbb{F}_q(T)$ that gives a sufficient and necessary condition for which a unit of norm $1$ in $\\\\mathbb{K}_{\\\\wp}$ can be written as a quotient of conjugate units. In this paper, as a main theorem, we prove that the decision version of the Frobenius problem is Sigma_2^P-complete under Karp reductions.Given a finite set A of coprime positive integers, we call the greatest integer that cannot be represented as a nonnegative integer combination of A the Frobenius number, and we denote it as g(A). We call a problem of finding g(A) for a given A the Frobenius problem; moreover, we call a problem of determining whether g(A) >= k for a given pair (A, k) the decision version of the Frobenius problem, where A is a finite set of coprime positive integers and k is a positive integer. For the proof, we construct two Karp reductions. First, we reduce a 2-alternating version of the 3-dimensional matching problem, which is known to be Pi_2^P-complete, to a 2-alternating version of the integer knapsack problem. Then, we reduce the variant of the integer knapsack problem to the complement of the decision version of the Frobenius problem. As a corollary, we obtain the main theorem. A new class of full fans in an euclidean space - tight fans - is introduced. Such fans are defined using a property of local symmetry in a face of a tiling. Tight fans are related to the theory of parallelotopes in an euclidean space. A theorem is proved that a fan of cells meeting in a given face of a tiling by parallelotopes is a tight fan. A new proof was given for a theorem by Delone on 5 combinatorial types of parallelotopes meeting in a common face of codimension 3. Canonical scalings of an euclidean space tiling are special functions defined on hyperfaces of the tiling. Existance of such functions for a given tiling is known to be related to existance of a generatix of a tiling. Generatix is a polyhedral surface with an orthogonal projection coinciding with a given tiling. A theroem is proved that a fan has a canonical scaling iff it is polytopical. A $p$-caterpillar is a caterpillar such that every non-leaf vertex is adjacent to exactly $p$ leaves. We give a tight minimum degree condition for a graph to have a spanning $p$-caterpillar. Let $\\\\mathscr{M}$ be a finite von Neumann algebra with a faithful normal tracial state $\\\\tau$ and $\\\\mathfrak{A}$ be a finite subdiagonal subalgebra of $\\\\mathscr{M}$ with respect to a $\\\\tau$-preserving faithful normal conditional expectation $\\\\Phi$ on $\\\\mathscr{M}$. Let $\\\\Delta$ denote the Fuglede-Kadison determinant corresponding to $\\\\tau$. For $X \\\\in \\\\mathscr{M}$, define $|X| := (X^*X)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}$. In 2005, Labuschagne proved the so-called Jensen\\'s inequality for finite subdiagonal algebras i.e. $\\\\Delta(\\\\Phi(A)) \\\\le \\\\Delta(A)$ for an operator $A \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{A}$, thus resolving a long-standing open problem posed by Arveson in 1967. In this article, we prove the following more general result: $\\\\tau(f( |\\\\Phi(A)|)) \\\\le \\\\tau(f( |A|))$ for $A \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{A}$ and any increasing continuous function $f : [0, \\\\infty) \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}$ such that $f \\\\circ \\\\exp$ is convex on $\\\\mathbb{R}$. Under the additional hypotheses that $A$ is invertible in $\\\\mathscr{M}$ and $f \\\\circ \\\\exp$ is strictly convex, we have $\\\\tau(f( |\\\\Phi(A)|)) = \\\\tau(f( |A|))$ $\\\\Longleftrightarrow \\\\Phi(A) = A$. As an application, we show that for $A \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{A}$ the point spectrum of $A$ is contained in the point spectrum of $\\\\Phi(A)$, though such a conclusion does not hold in general for their spectra. Let $A$ be a symmetric linear relation in the Hilbert space $\\\\gH$ with equal deficiency indices $n_\\\\pm (A)\\\\leq\\\\infty$. A self-adjoint linear relation $\\\\wt A\\\\supset A$ in some Hilbert space $\\\\wt\\\\gH\\\\supset \\\\gH$ is called an exit space extension of $A$; such an extension is called finite-codimensional if $\\\\dim (\\\\wt\\\\gH\\\\ominus\\\\gH)< \\\\infty$. We study the compressions $C (\\\\wt A)=P_\\\\gH\\\\wt A\\\\up\\\\gH$ of exit space extensions $\\\\wt A=\\\\wt A^*$. For a certain class of extensions $\\\\wt A$ we parameterize the compressions $C (\\\\wt A)$ by means of abstract boundary conditions. This enables us to characterize various properties of $C (\\\\wt A)$ (in particular, self-adjointness) in terms of the parameter for $\\\\wt A$ in the Krein formula for resolvents. We describe also the compressions of a certain class of finite-codimensional extensions. These results develop the results by A. Dijksma and H. Langer obtained for a densely defined symmetric operator $A$ with finite deficiency indices. We give an Ore-Type condition sufficient for a graph G to have a spanning tree with a specified degree sequence. It is known that a backward Schramm--Loewner evolution (SLE) is coupled with a free boundary Gaussian free field (GFF) with boundary perturbation to give a conformal welding of a quantum surface. Motivated by a generalization of conformal welding for a quantum surface with multiple marked boundary points, we propose a notion of multiple backward SLE. To this aim, we investigate a commutation relation between two backward Loewner chains, and consequently, we find that the driving process of each backward Loewner chain has to have a drift term given by logarithmic derivative of a partition function, which is determined by a system of Belavin--Polyakov--Zamolodchikov-like equations so that these Loewner chains are commutative. After this observation, we define a multiple backward SLE as a tuple of mutually commutative backward Loewner chains. It immediately follows that each backward Loewner chain in a multiple backward SLE is obtained as a Girsanov transform of a backward SLE. We also discuss coupling of a multiple backward SLE with a GFF with boundary perturbation and find that a partition function and a boundary perturbation are uniquely determined so that they are coupled with each other. We prove the $L^p$ boundedness of a maximal operator associated with a dyadic frequency decomposition of a Fourier multiplier, under a weak regularity assumption. In a recent paper, the authors have proved that for lattices A and B with zero, the isomorphism $Conc(A \\\\otimes B)\\\\cong Conc A \\\\otimes Conc B$, holds, provided that the tensor product satis&#64257;es a very natural condition (of being capped) implying that $A\\\\otimes B$ is a lattice. In general, $A \\\\otimes B$ is not a lattice; for instance, we proved that $M\\\\_3\\\\otimes F(3)$ is not a lattice. In this paper, we introduce a new lattice construction, the box product for arbitrary lattices. The tensor product construction for complete lattices introduced by G. N. Raney in 1960 and by R. Wille in 1985 and the tensor product construction of A. Fraser in 1978 for semilattices bear some formal resemblance to the new construction. For lattices A and B, while their tensor product $A\\\\otimes B$ (as semilattices) is not always a lattice, the box product, $A \\\\bp B$, is always a lattice. Furthermore, the box product and some of its ideals behave like an improved tensor product. For example, if A and B are lattices with unit, then the isomorphism $Conc(A $\\\\bp$ B) \\\\cong Conc A \\\\otimes Conc B$ holds. There are analogous results for lattices A and B with zero and for a bounded lattice A and an arbitrary lattice B. A join-semilattice S with zero is called {0}-representable, if there exists a lattice L with zero such that $Conc L \\\\cong S$. The above isomorphism results yield the following consequence: The tensor product of two {0}-representable semilattices is {0}-representable. Let $C$ be a unital AH-algebra and $A$ be a unital simple C*-algebra with tracial rank zero. It has been shown that two unital monomorphisms $\\\\phi, \\\\psi: C\\\\to A$ are approximately unitarily equivalent if and only if $$ [\\\\phi]=[\\\\psi] {\\\\rm in} KL(C,A) and \\\\tau\\\\circ \\\\phi=\\\\tau\\\\circ \\\\psi \\\\tforal \\\\tau\\\\in T(A), $$ where $T(A)$ is the tracial state space of $A.$ In this paper we prove the following: Given $\\\\kappa\\\\in KL(C,A)$ with $\\\\kappa(K_0(C)_+\\\\setminus \\\\{0\\\\})\\\\subset K_0(A)_+\\\\setminus \\\\{0\\\\}$ and with $\\\\kappa([1_C])=[1_A]$ and a continuous affine map $\\\\lambda: T(A)\\\\to T_{\\\\mathtt{f}}(C)$ which is compatible with $\\\\kappa,$ where $T_{\\\\mathtt{f}}(C)$ is the convex set of all faithful tracial states, there exists a unital monomorphism $\\\\phi: C\\\\to A$ such that $$ [\\\\phi]=\\\\kappa\\\\andeqn \\\\tau\\\\circ \\\\phi(c)=\\\\lambda(\\\\tau)(c) $$ for all $c\\\\in C_{s.a.}$ and $\\\\tau\\\\in T(A).$ Denote by ${\\\\rm Mon}_{au}^e(C,A)$ the set of approximate unitary equivalence classes of unital monomorphisms. We provide a bijective map $$ \\\\Lambda: {\\\\rm Mon}_{au}^e (C,A)\\\\to KLT(C,A)^{++}, $$ where $KLT(C,A)^{++}$ is the set of compatible pairs of elements in $KL(C,A)^{++}$ and continuous affine maps from $T(A)$ to $T_{\\\\mathtt{f}}(C).$ Moreover, we realized that there are compact metric spaces $X$, unital simple AF-algebras $A$ and $\\\\kappa\\\\in KL(C(X), A)$ with $\\\\kappa(K_0(C(X))_+\\\\setminus\\\\{0\\\\})\\\\subset K_0(A)_+\\\\setminus \\\\{0\\\\}$ for which there is no \\\\hm $h: C(X)\\\\to A$ so that $[h]=\\\\kappa.$ In this paper we concern with positive zero divisors in $C^{*}$ algebras. By means of zero divisors, we introduce a hereditary invariant for $C^{*}$ algebras. Using this invariant, we give an example of a $C^{*}$ algebra $A$ and a $C^{*}$ sub algebra $B$ of $A$ such that there is no a hereditary imbedding of $B$ into $A$. We also introduce a new concept zero divisor real rank of a $C^{*}$ algebra, as a zero divisor analogy of real rank theory of $C^{*}$ algebras. We observe that this quantity is zero for $A=C(X)$ when $X$ is a separable compact Hausdorff space or $X$ is homeomorphic to the unit square with the lexicographic topology. To a $C^{*}$ algebra $A$ with $\\\\dim A > 1$, we assign the undirected graph $\\\\Gamma^{+} (A)$ of non zero positive zero divisors. For the Calkin algebra $A=B(H)/K(H)$, we show that $\\\\Gamma^{+}(A)$ is a connected graph and diam $\\\\Gamma^{+}(A)= 3$. We show that $\\\\Gamma^{+}(A)$ is a connected graph with $\\\\text {diam}\\\\; \\\\Gamma^{+}(A)\\\\leq 6$, if $A$ is a factor. A hemiimplicative semilattice is a bounded semilattice $(A, \\\\wedge, 1)$ endowed with a binary operation $\\\\to$, satisfying that for every $a, b, c \\\\in A$, $a \\\\leq b \\\\to c$ implies $a \\\\wedge b \\\\leq c$ (that is to say, one of the conditionals satisfied by the residuum of the infimum) and the equation $a \\\\to a = 1$. The class of hemiimplicative semilattices form a variety. These structures provide a general framework for the study of different structures of interest in algebraic logic. In any hemiimplicative semilattice it is possible to define a derived operation by $a \\\\sim b := (a \\\\to b) \\\\wedge (b \\\\to a)$. Endowing $(A, \\\\wedge, 1)$ with the binary operation $\\\\sim$ results again a hemiimplicative semilattice, which also satisfies the identity $a \\\\sim b = b \\\\sim a$. We call the elements of the subvariety of hemiimplicative semilattices satisfying $a \\\\to b = b \\\\to a$, a symmetric hemiimplicative semilattice. In this article, we study the correspondence assigning the symmetric hemiimplicative semilattice $(A, \\\\wedge, \\\\sim , 1)$ to the hemiimplicative semilattice $(A, \\\\wedge, \\\\to, 1)$. In particular, we characterize the image of this correspondence. We also provide many new examples of hemiimplicative semilattice structures on any bounded semillatice (possibly with bottom). Finally, we characterize congruences on the clases of hemiimplicative semilattices introduced as examples and we describe the principal congruences of hemiimplicative semilattices. Let $\\\\mathcal A$ be a simple, $\\\\sigma$-unital, non-unital, non-elementary C*-algebra and let $I_{min}$ be the intersection of all the ideals of $\\\\mathcal M(\\\\mathcal A)$ that properly contain $\\\\mathcal A$. $I_{min}$ coincides with the ideal defined by Lin (Simple C*-algebras with continuous scales and simple corona algebras. 112, (1991) Proc. Amer.Math. Soc) in terms of approximate units of $\\\\mathcal A$ and $I_{min}/\\\\mathcal A$ is purely infinite and simple. If $\\\\mathcal A$ is separable, or if $\\\\mathcal A$ has the (SP) property and its dimension semigroup $D(\\\\mathcal A)$ of Murray-von Neumann equivalence classes of projections of $\\\\mathcal A$ is order separable, or if $\\\\mathcal A$ has strict comparison of positive elements by traces, then $\\\\mathcal A\\\\ne I_{min}$. If the tracial simplex $ \\\\mathcal T(\\\\mathcal A)$ is nonempty, let $ I_{con}$ be the closure of the linear span of the elements $A\\\\in\\\\mathcal M(\\\\mathcal A)_+$ such that the evaluation map $\\\\hat A(\\\\tau)=\\\\tau(A)$ is continuous. If $\\\\mathcal A$ has strict comparison of positive element by traces then $I_{min}= I_{con}$. Furthermore, $I_{min}$ too has strict comparison of positive elements in the sense that if $A, B\\\\in (I_{min})_+$, $B\\\\not \\\\in\\\\mathcal A$ and $d_\\\\tau(A)< d_\\\\tau(B)$ for all $\\\\tau\\\\in \\\\mathcal T(\\\\mathcal A)$ for which $d_\\\\tau(B)< \\\\infty$, then $A\\\\preceq B$. However if $\\\\mathcal A$ does not have strict comparison of positive elements by traces then $I_{min}\\\\ne I_{con}$ can occur: a counterexample is provided by Villadsen\\'s AH algebras without slow dimension growth. If the dimension growth is flat, $ I_{con}$ is the largest proper ideal of $\\\\mathcal M(\\\\mathcal A)$. Let $A$ be a ring with identity, $\\\\sigma$ a ring endomorphism of $A$ that maps the identity to itself, $\\\\delta$ a $\\\\sigma$-derivation of $A$, and consider the skew-polynomial ring $A[X;\\\\sigma,\\\\delta]$. When $A$ is a finite field, a Galois ring, or a general ring, some fairly recent literature used $A[X;\\\\sigma,\\\\delta]$ to construct new interesting codes (e.g. skew-cyclic and skew-constacyclic codes) that generalize their classical counterparts over finite fields (e.g. cyclic and constacyclic linear codes). This paper presents results concerning {\\\\it principal} $(f, \\\\sigma, \\\\delta)$-codes over a ring $A$, where $f\\\\in A[X;\\\\sigma,\\\\delta]$ is monic. We provide recursive formulas that compute the entries of both a generating matrix and a control matrix of such a code $\\\\mathcal{C}$. When $A$ is a finite commutative ring with identity and $\\\\sigma$ is a ring automorphism of $A$, we also give recursive formulas for the entries of a parity-check matrix of $\\\\mathcal{C}$. Also in this case, with $\\\\delta=0$, we give a generating matrix of the dual $\\\\mathcal{C}^\\\\perp$, present a characterization of principal $\\\\sigma$-codes whose duals are also principal $\\\\sigma$-codes, and deduce a characterization of self-dual principal $\\\\sigma$-codes. Some corollaries concerning principal $\\\\sigma$-constacyclic codes are also given, and some highlighting examples are provided. The `full\\' edge isoperimetric inequality for the discrete cube (due to Harper, Bernstein, Lindsay and Hart) specifies the minimum size of the edge boundary $\\\\partial A$ of a set $A \\\\subset \\\\{0,1\\\\}^n$, as a function of $|A|$. A weaker (but more widely-used) lower bound is $|\\\\partial A| \\\\geq |A| \\\\log_2(2^n/|A|)$, where equality holds iff $A$ is a subcube. In 2011, the first author obtained a sharp `stability\\' version of the latter result, proving that if $|\\\\partial A| \\\\leq |A| (\\\\log(2^n/|A|)+\\\\epsilon)$, then there exists a subcube $C$ such that $|A \\\\Delta C|/|A| = O(\\\\epsilon /\\\\log(1/\\\\epsilon))$. The `weak\\' version of the edge isoperimetric inequality has the following well-known generalization for the `$p$-biased\\' measure $\\\\mu_p$ on the discrete cube: if $p \\\\leq 1/2$, or if $0 < p < 1$ and $A$ is monotone increasing, then $p\\\\mu_p(\\\\partial A) \\\\geq \\\\mu_p(A) \\\\log_p(\\\\mu_p(A))$. In this paper, we prove a sharp stability version of the latter result, which generalizes the aforementioned result of the first author. Namely, we prove that if $p\\\\mu_p(\\\\partial A) \\\\leq \\\\mu_p(A) (\\\\log_p(\\\\mu_p(A))+\\\\epsilon)$, then there exists a subcube $C$ such that $\\\\mu_p(A \\\\Delta C)/\\\\mu_p(A) = O(\\\\epsilon\\' /\\\\log(1/\\\\epsilon\\'))$, where $\\\\epsilon\\' =\\\\epsilon \\\\ln (1/p)$. This result is a central component in recent work of the authors proving sharp stability versions of a number of Erd\\\\H{o}s-Ko-Rado type theorems in extremal combinatorics, including the seminal `complete intersection theorem\\' of Ahlswede and Khachatrian. In addition, we prove a biased-measure analogue of the `full\\' edge isoperimetric inequality, for monotone increasing sets, and we observe that such an analogue does not hold for arbitrary sets, hence answering a question of Kalai. We use this result to give a new proof of the `full\\' edge isoperimetric inequality, one relying on the Kruskal-Katona theorem. The aim of this paper is to relate algebraic quantum mechanics to topos theory, so as to construct new foundations for quantum logic and quantum spaces. Motivated by Bohr\\'s idea that the empirical content of quantum physics is accessible only through classical physics, we show how a C*-algebra of observables A induces a topos T(A) in which the amalgamation of all of its commutative subalgebras comprises a single commutative C*-algebra. According to the constructive Gelfand duality theorem of Banaschewski and Mulvey, the latter has an internal spectrum S(A) in T(A), which in our approach plays the role of a quantum phase space of the system. Thus we associate a locale (which is the topos-theoretical notion of a space and which intrinsically carries the intuitionistic logical structure of a Heyting algebra) to a C*-algebra (which is the noncommutative notion of a space). In this setting, states on A become probability measures (more precisely, valuations) on S(A), and self-adjoint elements of A define continuous functions (more precisely, locale maps) from S(A) to Scott\\'s interval domain. Noting that open subsets of S(A) correspond to propositions about the system, the pairing map that assigns a (generalized) truth value to a state and a proposition assumes an extremely simple categorical form. Formulated in this way, the quantum theory defined by A is essentially turned into a classical theory, internal to the topos T(A). Let $(A,\\\\Delta)$ be a regular weak multiplier Hopf algebra. Denote by $E$ the canonical idempotent of $(A,\\\\Delta)$ and by $B$ the image of the source map. Recall that $B$ is a non-degenerate algebra, sitting nicely in the multiplier algebra $M(A)$ of $A$ so that also $M(B)$ can be viewed as a subalgebra of $M(A)$. Assume that $u,v$ are invertible elements in $M(B)$ so that $E(vu\\\\otimes 1)E=E$. This last condition is obviously fulfilled if $u$ and $v$ are each other inverses, but there are also other cases. Now modify $\\\\Delta$ and define $\\\\Delta\\'(a)=(u\\\\otimes 1)\\\\Delta(a)(v\\\\otimes 1)$ for all $a \\\\in A$. We show in this paper that $(A,\\\\Delta\\')$ is again a regular weak multiplier Hopf algebra and we obtain formulas for the various data of $(A,\\\\Delta\\')$ in terms of the data associated with the original pair $(A,\\\\Delta)$. In the case of a finite-dimensional weak Hopf algebra, the above deformation is a special case of the twists as studied by Nikshych and Vainerman. It is known that any regular weak multiplier Hopf algebra gives rise in a natural way to a regular multiplier Hopf algebroid. This result applies to both the original weak multiplier Hopf algebra $(A,\\\\Delta)$ and the modified version $(A,\\\\Delta\\')$. However, the same method can be used to associate another regular multiplier Hopf algebroid to the triple $(A,\\\\Delta,\\\\Delta\\')$. This turns out to give an example of a regular multiplier Hopf algebroid that does not arise from a regular weak multiplier Hopf algebra although the base algebra is separable Frobenius. The $e^+e^-\\\\to K^+K^-$ cross section is measured in the center-of-mass energy range $1.05-2.00$ GeV at the SND detector. The measurement is based on data with an integrated luminosity of 35 pb$^{-1}$ collected at the VEPP-2000 $e^+e^-$-collider. The obtained results are consistent with the previous most accurate data obtained in the BABAR experiment and have a comparable accuracy. Developing an efficient non-linear Horn clause solver is a challenging task since the solver has to reason about the tree structures rather than the linear ones as in a linear solver. In this paper we propose an incremental approach to solving a set of non-linear Horn clauses using a linear Horn clause solver. We achieve this by interleaving a program transformation and a linear solver. The program transformation is based on the notion of tree dimension, which we apply to trees corresponding to Horn clause derivations. The dimension of a tree is a measure of its non-linearity -- for example a linear tree (whose nodes have at most one child) has dimension zero while a complete binary tree has dimension equal to its height. A given set of Horn clauses $P$ can be transformed into a new set of clauses $P^k$ (whose derivation trees are the subset of $P$\\'s derivation trees with dimension at most $k$). We start by generating $P^k$ with $k=0$, which is linear by definition, then pass it to a linear solver. If $P^k$ has a solution $M$, and is a solution to $P$ then $P$ has a solution $M$. If $M$ is not a solution of $P$, we plugged $M$ to $P^{(k+1)}$ which again becomes linear and pass it to the solver and continue successively for increasing value of $k$ until we find a solution to $P$ or resources are exhausted. Experiment on some Horn clause verification benchmarks indicates that this is a promising approach for solving a set of non-linear Horn clauses using a linear solver. It indicates that many times a solution obtained for some under-approximation $P^k$ of $P$ becomes a solution for $P$ for a fairly small value of $k$. Let $\\\\operatorname{CDG}_{cont}$ be the category whose objects are pairs $(A,\\\\bar{\\\\mathfrak{a}})$, where $A$ is a commutative DG-algebra and $\\\\bar{\\\\mathfrak{a}}\\\\subseteq \\\\mathrm{H}^0(A)$ is a finitely generated ideal, and whose morphisms $f:(A,\\\\bar{\\\\mathfrak{a}}) \\\\to (B,\\\\bar{\\\\mathfrak{b}})$ are morphisms of DG-algebras $A \\\\to B$, such that $(\\\\mathrm{H}^0(f)(\\\\bar{\\\\mathfrak{a}})) \\\\subseteq \\\\bar{\\\\mathfrak{b}}$. Letting $\\\\mathrm{Ho}(\\\\operatorname{CDG}_{cont})$ be its homotopy category, obtained by inverting adic quasi-isomorphisms, we construct a functor $\\\\mathrm{L}\\\\Lambda:\\\\mathrm{Ho}(\\\\operatorname{CDG}_{cont}) \\\\to \\\\mathrm{Ho}(\\\\operatorname{CDG}_{cont})$ which takes a pair $(A,\\\\bar{\\\\mathfrak{a}})$ into its non-abelian derived $\\\\bar{\\\\mathfrak{a}}$-adic completion. We show that this operation has, in a derived sense, the usual properties of adic completion of commutative rings, and that if $A = \\\\mathrm{H}^0(A)$ is an ordinary noetherian ring, this operation coincides with ordinary adic completion. As an application, following a question of Buchweitz and Flenner, we show that if $\\\\Bbbk$ is a commutative ring, and $A$ is a commutative $\\\\Bbbk$-algebra which is $\\\\mathfrak{a}$-adically complete with respect to a finitely generated ideal $\\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\subseteq A$, then the derived Hochschild cohomology modules $\\\\operatorname{Ext}^n_{A\\\\otimes^{\\\\mathrm{L}}_{\\\\Bbbk} A} (A,A)$ and the derived complete Hochschild cohomology modules $\\\\operatorname{Ext}^n_{A\\\\widehat{\\\\otimes}^{\\\\mathrm{L}}_{\\\\Bbbk} A} (A,A)$ coincide, without assuming any finiteness or noetherian conditions on $\\\\Bbbk, A$ or on the map $\\\\Bbbk \\\\to A$. In this paper, the variation of a signal in Schwarzschild spacetime is studied and a general equation for frequency shift parameter (FSP) is presented. It shows that FSP depends on the gravitationally-modified Doppler effects and the gravitational effects of observers. In addition, rates of time of a transmitter and a receiver may be different. When FSP is a function of the time of a receiver, FSP contributed by gravitational effect (GFSP) or gravitationally-modified Doppler effect (GMDFSP) may lead a bandlimited signal to a non-bandlimited signal. Based on the equation, FSP as a function of the time of a receiver is calculated for three scenarios: a) a spaceship moves away from a star with a constant velocity communicating with a transmitter at a fixed position; b) a spaceship moves around a star with different conic trajectories communicating with a transmitter at a fixed position; c) a signal is transmitted at a fixed position in a star system to a receiver moving with an elliptical trajectory in another star system. The studied stars are sun-like star, white dwarf and neutron star, and some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theory. Magnetic fluctuations with a zero mean field in a random flow with a finite correlation time and a small yet finite magnetic diffusion are studied. Equation for the second-order correlation function of a magnetic field is derived. This equation comprises spatial derivatives of high orders due to a non-local nature of magnetic field transport in a random velocity field with a finite correlation time. For a random Gaussian velocity field with a small correlation time the equation for the second-order correlation function of the magnetic field is a third-order partial differential equation. For this velocity field and a small magnetic diffusion with large magnetic Prandtl numbers the growth rate of the second moment of magnetic field is estimated. The finite correlation time of a turbulent velocity field causes an increase of the growth rate of magnetic fluctuations. It is demonstrated that the results obtained for the cases of a small yet finite magnetic diffusion and a zero magnetic diffusion are different. Astrophysical applications of the obtained results are discussed. Boundary conditions for unconventional superconducting order parameter are obtained on the basis of a microscopic theory. The upper critical field in a superconducting film is examined for unconventional superconductors with two-component order parameter and is compared with the case of accidental degeneracy. It is shown, that for both cases temperature dependences of the upper critical field in a superconducting film may depend substantially on the quality of boundaries, and under certain conditions have a kink due to the influence of film boundaries. The location of a kink point appears to be dependent on a film thickness. If for a massive sample there is another reason for the existance of a kink, the interplay of the reasons may lead to a specific behaviour of a kink point location as a function of a temperature or a film thickness. A new test is suggested permitting to distinguish between $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ types of pairing in a hexagonal superconductor near $T_c$. For a Lie-Rinehart algebra (A,L), generators for the Gerstenhaber algebra \\\\Lambda_A L correspond bijectively to right (A,L)-connections on A in such a way that B-V structures correspond to right (A,L)-module structures on A. When L is projective as an A-module, given an exact generator \\\\partial, the homology of the B-V algebra (\\\\Lambda_A L,\\\\partial) coincides with that of L with coefficients in A with respect to the right (A,L)-module structure determined by \\\\partial. When L is also of finite rank n, there are bijective correspondences between (A,L)-connections on \\\\Lambda_A^nL and right (A,L)-connections on A and between left (A,L)- module structures on \\\\Lambda_A^nL and right (A,L)-module structures on A. Hence there are bijective correspondences between (A,L)-connections on \\\\Lambda_A^n L and generators for the Gerstenhaber bracket on \\\\Lambda_A L and between (A,L)-module structures on \\\\Lambda_A^n L and B-V algebra structures on \\\\Lambda_A L. The homology of such a B-V algebra (\\\\Lambda_A L,\\\\partial) coincides with the cohomology of L with coefficients in \\\\Lambda_A^n L, for the left (A,L)-module structure determined by \\\\partial. Some applications are discussed. The evolution of a Universe modelled as a mixture of a Chaplygin gas and radiation is determined by taking into account irreversible processes. This mixture could interpolate periods of a radiation dominated, a matter dominated and a cosmological constant dominated Universe. The results of a Universe modelled by this mixture are compared with the results of a mixture whose constituents are radiation and quintessence. Among other results it is shown that: (a) for both models there exists a period of a past deceleration with a present acceleration; (b) the slope of the acceleration of the Universe modelled as a mixture of a Chaplygin gas with radiation is more pronounced than that modelled as a mixture of quintessence and radiation; (c) the energy density of the Chaplygin gas tends to a constant value at earlier times than the energy density of quintessence does; (d) the energy density of radiation for both mixtures coincide and decay more rapidly than the energy densities of the Chaplygin gas and of quintessence. Let $A$ be a Banach algebra, not necessarily unital, and let $B$ be a closed subalgebra of $A$. We establish a connection between the Banach cyclic cohomology group $ {\\\\cal{HC}}^n(A)$ of $A$ and the Banach $B$-relative cyclic cohomology group $ {\\\\cal{HC}}^n_B(A) $ of $A$. We prove that, for a Banach algebra $A$ with a bounded approximate identity and an amenable closed subalgebra $B$ of $A$, up to topological isomorphism, ${\\\\cal{HC}}^n(A) = {\\\\cal{HC}}^n_B(A) $ for all $n \\\\ge 0$. We also establish a connection between the Banach simplicial or cyclic cohomology groups of $A$ and those of the quotient algebra $A/I$ by an amenable closed bi-ideal $I$. The results are applied to the calculation of these groups for certain operator algebras, including von Neumann algebras. First, we study recollement of a derived category of unbounded complexes of modules induced by a partial tilting complex. Second, we give equivalent conditions for P^{centerdot} to be a recollement tilting complex, that is, a tilting complex which induces an equivalence between recollements $\\\\{\\\\cat{D}_{A/AeA}(A), \\\\cat{D}(A), \\\\cat{D}(eAe)}$ and $\\\\{\\\\cat{D}_{B/BfB}(B), \\\\cat{D}(B), \\\\cat{D}(fBf)}$, where e, f are idempotents of A, B, respectively. In this case, there is an unbounded bimodule complex $\\\\varDelta^{\\\\centerdot}_{T}$ which induces an equivalence between $\\\\cat{D}_{A/AeA}(A)$ and $\\\\cat{D}_{B/BfB}(B)$. Third, we apply the above to a symmetric algebra A. We show that a partial tilting complex $P^{\\\\centerdot}$ for A of length 2 extends to a tilting complex, and that $P^{\\\\centerdot}$ is a tilting complex if and only if the number of indecomposable types of $P^{\\\\centerdot}$ is one of A. Finally, we show that for an idempotent e of A, a tilting complex for eAe extends to a recollement tilting complex for A, and that its standard equivalence induces an equivalence between $\\\\cat{Mod}A/AeA$ and $\\\\cat{Mod}B/BfB$. The boundary of the Siegel disk of a quadratic polynomial with an irrationally indifferent fixed point with the golden mean rotation number has been observed to be self-similar. The geometry of this self-similarity is universal for a large class of holomorphic maps. A renormalization explanation of this universality has been proposed in the literature. However, one of the ingredients of this explanation, the hyperbolicity of renormalization, has not been proved yet. The present work considers a cylinder renormalization - a novel type of renormalization for holomorphic maps with a Siegel disk which is better suited for a hyperbolicity proof. A key element of a cylinder renormalization of a holomorphic map is a conformal isomorphism of a dynamical quotient of a subset of $\\\\field{C}$ to a bi-infinite cylinder $\\\\field{C} / \\\\field{Z}$. A construction of this conformal isomorphism is an implicit procedure which can be performed using the Measurable Riemann Mapping Theorem. We present a constructive proof of the Measurable Riemann Mapping Theorem, and obtain rigorous bounds on a numerical approximation of the desired conformal isomorphism. Such control of the uniformizing conformal coordinate is of key importance for a rigorous computer-assisted study of cylinder renormalization. Let $G$ be a locally compact group. Consider the C$^*$-algebra $C_0(G)$ of continuous complex functions on $G$, tending to 0 at infinity. The product in $G$ gives rise to a coproduct $\\\\Delta_G$ on the C$^*$-algebra $C_0(G)$. A locally compact {\\\\it quantum} group is a pair $(A,\\\\Delta)$ of a C$^*$-algebra $A$ with a coproduct $\\\\Delta$ on $A$, satisfying certain conditions. The definition guarantees that the pair $(C_0(G),\\\\Delta_G)$ is a locally compact quantum group and that conversely, every locally compact quantum group $(A,\\\\Delta)$ is of this form when the underlying C$^*$-algebra $A$ is abelian. Assume now that $G$ is a locally compact group with a compact open subgroup $K$. The algebra of complex functions on $G$ of {\\\\it polynomial type} is a dense multiplier Hopf $^*$-algebra with positive integrals (i.e. an algebraic quantum group}. The characteristic function of $K$ is a group-like projection in this algebraic quantum group. In this paper, we study group-like projections in an arbitrary algebraic quantum group. We find several associated objects that generalize the classical objects associated to a compact open subgroup of a locally compact group. We introduce a notion of depth three tower of three rings C < B < A with depth two ring extension A | B recovered when B = C. If A = \\\\End B_C and B | C is a Frobenius extension, this captures the notion of depth three for a Frobenius extension in arXiv:math/0107064 and arXiv:math/0108067, such that if B | C is depth three, then A | C is depth two (a phenomenon of finite depth subfactors, see arXiv:math/0006057). We provide a similar definition of finite depth Frobenius extension with embedding theorem utilizing a depth three subtower of the Jones tower. If A, B and C correspond to a tower of subgroups G > H > K via the group algebra over a fixed base ring, the depth three condition is the condition that subgroup K has normal closure K^G contained in H. For a depth three tower of rings, there is a pre-Galois theory for the ring \\\\End {}_BA_C and coring (A \\\\o_B A)^C involving Morita context bimodules and left coideal subrings. This is applied in two sections to a specialization of a Jacobson-Bourbaki correspondence theorem for augmented rings to depth two extensions with depth three intermediate division rings. Single spin asymmetry in inclusive $\\\\pi^0$-production was measured in the polarized target fragmentation region using 50 GeV proton beam. The asymmetry is in agreement with asymmetry measurements in the polarized beam fragmentation region carried out at higher energies. The measurement completed 30-years history of polarized measurements at the PROZA setup. Let $A(n,d)$ be the maximum number of $0,1$ words of length $n$, any two having Hamming distance at least $d$. We prove $A(20,8)=256$, which implies that the quadruply shortened Golay code is optimal. Moreover, we show $A(18,6)\\\\leq 673$, $A(19,6)\\\\leq 1237$, $A(20,6)\\\\leq 2279$, $A(23,6)\\\\leq 13674$, $A(19,8)\\\\leq 135$, $A(25,8)\\\\leq 5421$, $A(26,8)\\\\leq 9275$, $A(21,10)\\\\leq 47$, $A(22,10)\\\\leq 84$, $A(24,10)\\\\leq 268$, $A(25,10)\\\\leq 466$, $A(26,10)\\\\leq 836$, $A(27,10)\\\\leq 1585$, $A(25,12)\\\\leq 55$, and $A(26,12)\\\\leq 96$. The method is based on the positive semidefiniteness of matrices derived from quadruples of words. This can be put as constraint in a semidefinite program, whose optimum value is an upper bound for $A(n,d)$. The order of the matrices involved is huge. However, the semidefinite program is highly symmetric, by which its feasible region can be restricted to the algebra of matrices invariant under this symmetry. By block diagonalizing this algebra, the order of the matrices will be reduced so as to make the program solvable with semidefinite programming software in the above range of values of $n$ and $d$. In this paper we derive a technique of obtaining limit theorems for suprema of L\\\\\\'evy processes from their random walk counterparts. For each $a>0$, let $\\\\{Y^{(a)}_n:n\\\\ge 1\\\\}$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables and $\\\\{X^{(a)}_t:t\\\\ge 0\\\\}$ be a L\\\\\\'evy processes such that $X_1^{(a)}\\\\stackrel{d}{=} Y_1^{(a)}$, $\\\\mathbb E X_1^{(a)}<0$ and $\\\\mathbb E X_1^{(a)}\\\\uparrow0$ as $a\\\\downarrow0$. Let $S^{(a)}_n=\\\\sum_{k=1}^n Y^{(a)}_k$. Then, under some mild assumptions, $\\\\Delta(a)\\\\max_{n\\\\ge 0} S_n^{(a)}\\\\stackrel{d}{\\\\to} R\\\\iff\\\\Delta(a)\\\\sup_{t\\\\ge 0} X^{(a)}_t\\\\stackrel{d}{\\\\to} R$, for some random variable $R$ and some function $\\\\Delta(\\\\cdot)$. We utilize this result to present a number of limit theorems for suprema of L\\\\\\'evy processes in the heavy-traffic regime. Let A be a von Neumann algebra with a finite trace $\\\\tau$, represented in $H=L^2(A,\\\\tau)$, and let $B_t\\\\subset A$ be sub-algebras, for $t$ in an interval $I$. Let $E_t:A\\\\to B_t$ be the unique $\\\\tau$-preserving conditional expectation. We say that the path $t\\\\mapsto E_t$ is smooth if for every $a\\\\in A$ and $v \\\\in H$, the map $$ I\\\\ni t\\\\mapsto E_t(a)v\\\\in H $$ is continuously differentiable. This condition implies the existence of the derivative operator $$ dE_t(a):H\\\\to H, \\\\ dE_t(a)v=\\\\frac{d}{dt}E_t(a)v. $$ If this operator verifies the additional boundedness condition, $$ \\\\int_J \\\\|dE_t(a)\\\\|_2^2 d t\\\\le C_J\\\\|a\\\\|_2^2, $$ for any closed bounded sub-interval $J\\\\subset I$, and $C_J>0$ a constant depending only on $J$, then the algebras $B_t$ are *-isomorphic. More precisely, there exists a curve $G_t:A\\\\to A$, $t\\\\in I$ of unital, *-preserving linear isomorphisms which intertwine the expectations, $$ G_t\\\\circ E_0=E_t\\\\circ G_t. $$ The curve $G_t$ is weakly continuously differentiable. Moreover, the intertwining property in particular implies that $G_t$ maps $B_0$ onto $B_t$. We show that this restriction is a multiplicative isomorphism. We establish a mutual relationship between main analytic objects for the dissipative extension theory of a symmetric operator $\\\\dot A$ with deficiency indices $(1,1)$. In particular, we introduce the Weyl-Titchmarsh function $\\\\cM$ of a maximal dissipative extension $\\\\hat A$ of the symmetric operator $\\\\dot A$. Given a reference self-adjoint extension $A$ of $\\\\dot A$, we introduce a von Neumann parameter $\\\\kappa$, $|\\\\kappa|<1$, characterizing the domain of the dissipative extension $\\\\hat A$ against $\\\\Dom (A)$ and show that the pair $(\\\\kappa, \\\\cM)$ is a complete unitary invariant of the triple $(\\\\dot A, A, \\\\hat A)$, unless $\\\\kappa=0$. As a by-product of our considerations we obtain a relevant functional model for a dissipative operator and get an analog of the formula of Krein for its resolvent. In the paper, the authors discover the best constants $\\\\alpha_{1}$, $\\\\alpha_{2}$, $\\\\beta_{1}$, and $\\\\beta_{2}$ for the double inequalities $$ \\\\alpha_{1}\\\\bar{C}(a,b)+(1-\\\\alpha_{1}) A(a,b)< T(a,b) <\\\\beta_{1} \\\\bar{C}(a,b)+(1-\\\\beta_{1})A(a,b) $$ and $$ \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{2}}{A(a,b)}+\\\\frac{1-\\\\alpha_{2}}{\\\\bar{C}(a,b)}<\\\\frac1{T(a,b)} <\\\\frac{\\\\beta_{2}}{A(a,b)}+\\\\frac{1-\\\\beta_{2}}{\\\\bar{C}(a,b)} $$ to be valid for all $a,b>0$ with $a\\\\ne b$, where $$ \\\\bar{C}(a,b)=\\\\frac{2(a^{2}+ab+b^{2})}{3(a+b)},\\\\quad A(a,b)=\\\\frac{a+b}2, $$ and $$ T(a,b)=\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi}\\\\int_{0}^{{\\\\pi}/{2}}\\\\sqrt{a^2{\\\\cos^2{\\\\theta}}+b^2{\\\\sin^2{\\\\theta}}}\\\\,\\\\td\\\\theta $$ are respectively the centroidal, arithmetic, and Toader means of two positive numbers $a$ and $b$. As an application of the above inequalities, the authors also find some new bounds for the complete elliptic integral of the second kind. This paper presents a tableau calculus for finding a model for a set-satisfiable finite set of formulas of an extended fuzzy logic BL, a fuzzy logic BL with additional Baaz connective and the involutive negation, if such a model exists. The calculus is a generalisation of a tableau calculus for BL, which is based on the decomposition theorem for a continuous t-norm. The aforementioned tableau calculus for BL is used to prove that a formula A of the extended BL is valid with respect to all continuous t-norms or to find a continuous t-norm * and assignment V of propositional atoms to [0,1] such that *-evaluation V*(A)<1. The tableau calculus presented in this paper enables for a finite set of formulas F of the extended BL and a subset K of [0,1] to find a continuous t-norm * and assignment V of propositional atoms to [0,1] such that *-evaluation V*(A) belongs to K for all formulas A that belong to F, or alternatively to show that such a model does not exist. Estimating a constrained relation is a fundamental problem in machine learning. Special cases are classification (the problem of estimating a map from a set of to-be-classified elements to a set of labels), clustering (the problem of estimating an equivalence relation on a set) and ranking (the problem of estimating a linear order on a set). We contribute a family of probability measures on the set of all relations between two finite, non-empty sets, which offers a joint abstraction of multi-label classification, correlation clustering and ranking by linear ordering. Estimating (learning) a maximally probable measure, given (a training set of) related and unrelated pairs, is a convex optimization problem. Estimating (inferring) a maximally probable relation, given a measure, is a 01-linear program. It is solved in linear time for maps. It is NP-hard for equivalence relations and linear orders. Practical solutions for all three cases are shown in experiments with real data. Finally, estimating a maximally probable measure and relation jointly is posed as a mixed-integer nonlinear program. This formulation suggests a mathematical programming approach to semi-supervised learning. For A a separable unital C*-algebra and M a separable McDuff II_1-factor, we show that the space Hom_w(A,M) of weak approximate unitary equivalence classes of unital *-homomorphisms A \\\\rightarrow M may be considered as a closed, bounded, convex subset of a separable Banach space -- a variation on N. Brown\\'s convex structure Hom(N,R^U). When A is nuclear, Hom_w(A,M) is affinely homeomorphic to the trace space of A, but in general Hom_w(A,M) and the trace space of A do not share the same data (several examples are provided). We characterize extreme points of Hom_w(A,M) in the case where either A or M is amenable; and we give two different conditions -- one necessary and the other sufficient -- for extremality in general. The universality of C*(F_\\\\infty) is reflected in the fact that for any unital separable A, Hom_w(A,M) may be embedded as a face in Hom_w(C*(F_\\\\infty),M). We also extend Brown\\'s construction to apply more generally to Hom(A,M^U). We show that if $A$ and $B$ are finite sets of real numbers, then the number of triples $(a,b,c)\\\\in A\\\\times B\\\\times (A\\\\cup B)$ with $a+b=2c$ is at most $(0.15+o(1))(|A|+|B|)^2$ as $|A|+|B|\\\\to\\\\infty$. As a corollary, if $A$ is antisymmetric (that is, $A\\\\cap(-A)=\\\\est$), then there are at most $(0.3+o(1))|A|^2$ triples $(a,b,c)$ with $a,b,c\\\\in A$ and $a-b=2c$. In the general case where $A$ is not necessarily antisymmetric, we show that the number of triples $(a,b,c)$ with $a,b,c\\\\in A$ and $a-b=2c$ is at most $(0.5+o(1))|A|^2$. These estimates are sharp. We use the notion of $\\\\A$-compact sets, which are determined by a Banach operator ideal $\\\\A$, to show that most classic results of certain approximation properties and several Banach operator ideals can be systematically studied under this framework. We say that a Banach space enjoys the $\\\\A$-approximation property if the identity map is uniformly approximable on $\\\\A$-compact sets by finite rank operators. The Grothendieck\\'s classic approximation property is the $\\\\K$-approximation property for $\\\\K$ the ideal of compact operators and the $p$-approximation property is obtained as the $\\\\mathcal N^p$-approximation property for $\\\\mathcal N^p$ the ideal of right $p$-nuclear operators. We introduce a way to measure the size of $\\\\A$-compact sets and use it to give a norm on $\\\\K_\\\\A$, the ideal of $\\\\A$-compact operators. Most of our results concerning the operator Banach ideal $\\\\K_\\\\A$ are obtained for right-accessible ideals $\\\\A$. For instance, we prove that $\\\\K_\\\\A$ is a dual ideal, it is regular and we characterize its maximal hull. A strong concept of approximation property, which makes use of the norm defined on $\\\\K_\\\\A$, is also addressed. Finally, we obtain a generalization of Schwartz theorem with a revisited $\\\\epsilon$-product. Let $E$ be a linear space and suppose that $A$ is the global attractor of either (i) a homeomorphism $F:E\\\\rightarrow E$ or (ii) a semigroup $S(\\\\cdot)$ on $E$ that is injective on $A$. In both cases $A$ has trivial shape, and the dynamics on $A$ can be described by a homeomorphism $F:A\\\\rightarrow A$ (in the second case we set $F=S(t)$ for some $t>0$). If the topological dimension of $A$ is finite we show that for any $\\\\epsilon>0$ there is an embedding $e:A\\\\rightarrow{\\\\mathbb R}^k$, with $k\\\\sim{\\\\rm dim}(A)$, and a (dynamical) homeomorphism $f:\\\\R^k\\\\rightarrow\\\\R^k$ such that $F$ is conjugate to $f$ on $A$ (i.e.\\\\ $F|_A=e^{-1}\\\\circ f\\\\circ e$) and $f$ has an attractor $A_f$ with $e(A)\\\\subset A_f\\\\subset N(e(A),\\\\epsilon)$. In other words, we show that the dynamics on $A$ is essentially finite-dimensional. We characterise subsets of ${\\\\mathbb R}^n$ that can be the attractors of homeomorphisms as cellular sets, give elementary proofs of various topological results connected to Borsuk\\'s theory of shape and cellularity in Euclidean spaces, and prove a controlled homeomorphism extension theorem. The goal of this investigation was to overcome limitations of a persistency analysis, introduced by Benoit Mandelbrot for fractal Brownian processes: nondifferentiability, Brownian nature of process and a linear memory measure. We have extended a sense of a Hurst factor by consideration of a phase diffusion power law. It was shown that pre-catastrophic stabilization as an indicator of bifurcation leads to a new minimum of momentary phase diffusion, while bifurcation causes an increase of the momentary transport. Basic conclusions of a diffusive analysis have been compared to the Lyapunov stability model. An extended Reynolds parameter has been introduces as an indicator of phase transition. A combination of diffusive and Reynolds analysis has been applied for a description of a time series of Dow Jones Industrial weekly prices for a world financial crisis of 2007-2009. Diffusive and Reynolds parameters shown an extreme values in October 2008 when a mortgage crisis was fixed. A combined R/D description allowed distinguishing of short-memory and long memory shifts of a market evolution. It was stated that a systematic large scale failure of a financial system has begun in October 2008 and started fading in February 2009. We study algebraic closure and its relation with definable closure in free groups and more generally in torsion-free hyperbolic groups. Given a torsion-free hyperbolic group G and a nonabelian subgroup A of G, we describe G as a constructible group from the algebraic closure of A along cyclic subgroups. In particular, it follows that the algebraic closure of A is finitely generated, quasiconvex and hyperbolic. Suppose that G is free. Then the definable closure of A is a free factor of the algebraic closure of A and the rank of these groups is bounded by that of G. We prove that the algebraic closure of A coincides with the vertex group containing A in the generalized cyclic JSJ-decomposition of G relative to A. If the rank of G is bigger than 4, then G has a subgroup A such that the definable closure of A is a proper subgroup of the algebraic closure of A. This answers a question of Sela. For a linearly ordered group $G$ let us define a subset $A\\\\subseteq G$ to be a \\\\emph{shift-set} if for any $x,y,z\\\\in A$ with $y < x$ we get $x\\\\cdot y^{-1}\\\\cdot z\\\\in A$. We describe the natural partial order and solutions of equations on the semigroup $\\\\mathscr{B}(A)$ of shifts of positive cones of $A$. We study topologizations of the semigroup $\\\\mathscr{B}(A)$. In particular, we show that for an arbitrary countable linearly ordered group $G$ and a non-empty shift-set $A$ of $G$ every Baire shift-continuous $T_1$-topology $\\\\tau$ on $\\\\mathscr{B}(A)$ is discrete. Also we prove that for an arbitrary linearly non-densely ordered group $G$ and a non-empty shift-set $A$ of $G$, every shift-continuous Hausdorff topology $\\\\tau$ on the semigroup $\\\\mathscr{B}(A)$ is discrete, and hence $\\\\left(\\\\mathscr{B}(A),\\\\tau\\\\right)$ is a discrete subspace of any Hausdorff semitopological semigroup which contains $\\\\mathscr{B}(A)$ as a subsemigroup. A corollary of Kneser\\'s theorem, one sees that any finite non-empty subset $A$ of an abelian group $G = (G,+)$ with $|A + A| \\\\leq (2-\\\\eps) |A|$ can be covered by at most $\\\\frac{2}{\\\\eps}-1$ translates of a finite group $H$ of cardinality at most $(2-\\\\eps)|A|$. Using some arguments of Hamidoune, we establish an analogue in the noncommutative setting. Namely, if $A$ is a finite non-empty subset of a nonabelian group $G = (G,\\\\cdot)$ such that $|A \\\\cdot A| \\\\leq (2-\\\\eps) |A|$, then $A$ is either contained in a right-coset of a finite group $H$ of cardinality at most $\\\\frac{2}{\\\\eps}|A|$, or can be covered by at most $\\\\frac{2}{\\\\eps}-1$ right-cosets of a finite group $H$ of cardinality at most $|A|$. We also note some connections with some recent work of Sanders and of Petridis. Let $A$ be a left-symmetric (resp. Novikov) algebra, $E$ be a vector space containing $A$ as a subspace and $V$ be a complement of $A$ in $E$.The extending structures problem which asks for the classification of all left-symmetric (resp. Novikov) algebra structures on $E$ such that $A$ is a subalgebra of $E$ is studied. In this paper, the definition of the unified product of left-symmetric (resp. Novikov) algebras is introduced. It is shown that there exists a left-symmetric (resp. Novikov) algebra structure on $E$ such that $A$ is a subalgebra of $E$ if and only if $E$ is isomorphic to a unified product of $A$ and $V$. Two cohomological type objects $\\\\mathcal{H}_A^2(V,A)$ and $\\\\mathcal{H}^2(V,A)$ are constructed to give a theoretical answer to the extending structures problem. Furthermore, given an extension $A\\\\subset E$ of left-symmetric (resp. Novikov) algebras, another cohomological type object is constructed to classify all complements of $A$ in $E$. Several special examples are provided in details. Let $A$ be a commutative noetherian ring, let $\\\\mathfrak{a}\\\\subseteq A$ be an ideal, and let $I$ be an injective $A$-module. A basic result in the structure theory of injective modules states that the $A$-module $\\\\Gamma_{\\\\mathfrak{a}}(I)$ consisting of $\\\\mathfrak{a}$-torsion elements is also an injective $A$-module. Recently, de Jong proved a dual result: If $F$ is a flat $A$-module, then the $\\\\mathfrak{a}$-adic completion of $F$ is also a flat $A$-module. In this paper we generalize these facts to commutative noetherian DG-rings: let $A$ be a commutative non-positive DG-ring such that $\\\\mathrm{H}^0(A)$ is a noetherian ring, and for each $i<0$, the $\\\\mathrm{H}^0(A)$-module $\\\\mathrm{H}^i(A)$ is finitely generated. Given an ideal $\\\\bar{\\\\mathfrak{a}} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathrm{H}^0(A)$, we show that the local cohomology functor $\\\\mathrm{R}\\\\Gamma_{\\\\bar{\\\\mathfrak{a}}}$ associated to $\\\\bar{\\\\mathfrak{a}}$ does not increase injective dimension. Dually, the derived $\\\\bar{\\\\mathfrak{a}}$-adic completion functor $\\\\mathrm{L}\\\\Lambda_{\\\\bar{\\\\mathfrak{a}}}$ does not increase flat dimension. Let $A$ be a ring with $1\\\\neq 0$, not necessarily finite, endowed with an involution~$*$, that is, an anti-automorphism of order $\\\\leq 2$. Let $H_n(A)$ be the additive group of all $n\\\\times n$ hermitian matrices over $A$ relative to $*$. Let ${\\\\mathcal U}_n(A)$ be the subgroup of $\\\\mathrm{GL}_n(A)$ of all upper triangular matrices with 1\\'s along the main diagonal. Let $P=H_n(A)\\\\rtimes {\\\\mathcal U}_n(A)$, where ${\\\\mathcal U}_n(A)$ acts on $H_n(A)$ by $*$-congruence transformations. We may view $P$ as a unipotent subgroup of either a symplectic group $\\\\mathrm{Sp}_{2n}(A)$, if $*=1_A$ (in which case $A$ is commutative), or a unitary group $\\\\mathrm{U}_{2n}(A)$ if $*\\\\neq 1_A$. In this paper we construct and classify a family of irreducible representations of $P$ over a field $F$ that is essentially arbitrary. In particular, when $A$ is finite and $F=\\\\mathbb C$ we obtain irreducible representations of $P$ of the highest possible degree. Let $a(z)=\\\\sum_{i\\\\in\\\\mathbb Z}a_iz^i$ be a complex valued continuous function, defined for $|z|=1$, such that $\\\\sum_{i=-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}|ia_i|<\\\\infty$. Consider the semi-infinite Toeplitz matrix $T(a)=(t_{i,j})_{i,j\\\\in\\\\mathbb Z^+}$ associated with the symbol $a(z)$ such that $t_{i,j}=a_{j-i}$. A quasi-Toeplitz matrix associated with the continuous symbol $a(z)$ is a matrix of the form $A=T(a)+E$ where $E=(e_{i,j})$, $\\\\sum_{i,j\\\\in\\\\mathbb Z^+}|e_{i,j}|<\\\\infty$, and is called a CQT-matrix. Given a function $f(x)$ and a CQT matrix $M$, we provide conditions under which $f(M)$ is well defined and is a CQT matrix. Moreover, we introduce a parametrization of CQT matrices and algorithms for the computation of $f(M)$. We treat the case where $f(x)$ is assigned in terms of power series and the case where $f(x)$ is defined in terms of a Cauchy integral. This analysis is applied also to finite matrices which can be written as the sum of a Toeplitz matrix and of a low rank correction. We initiate the study of the completely bounded multipliers of the Haagerup tensor product $A(G)\\\\otimes_{\\\\rm h} A(G)$ of two copies of the Fourier algebra $A(G)$ of a locally compact group $G$. If $E$ is a closed subset of $G$ we let $E^{\\\\sharp} = \\\\{(s,t) : st\\\\in E\\\\}$ and show that if $E^{\\\\sharp}$ is a set of spectral synthesis for $A(G)\\\\otimes_{\\\\rm h} A(G)$ then $E$ is a set of local spectral synthesis for $A(G)$. Conversely, we prove that if $E$ is a set of spectral synthesis for $A(G)$ and $G$ is a Moore group then $E^{\\\\sharp}$ is a set of spectral synthesis for $A(G)\\\\otimes_{\\\\rm h} A(G)$. Using the natural identification of the space of all completely bounded weak* continuous $VN(G)\\'$-bimodule maps with the dual of $A(G)\\\\otimes_{\\\\rm h} A(G)$, we show that, in the case $G$ is weakly amenable, such a map leaves the multiplication algebra of $L^{\\\\infty}(G)$ invariant if and only if its support is contained in the antidiagonal of $G$. The reticulation of an algebra $A$ is a bounded distributive lattice ${\\\\cal L}(A)$ whose prime spectrum of filters or ideals is homeomorphic to the prime spectrum of congruences of $A$, endowed with the Stone topologies. We have obtained a construction for the reticulation of any algebra $A$ from a semi-degenerate congruence-modular variety ${\\\\cal C}$ in the case when the commutator of $A$, applied to compact congruences of $A$, produces compact congruences, in particular when ${\\\\cal C}$ has principal commutators; furthermore, it turns out that weaker conditions than the fact that $A$ belongs to a congruence-modular variety are sufficient for $A$ to have a reticulation. This construction generalizes the reticulation of a commutative unitary ring, as well as that of a residuated lattice, which in turn generalizes the reticulation of a BL-algebra and that of an MV-algebra. The purpose of constructing the reticulation for the algebras from ${\\\\cal C}$ is that of transferring algebraic and topological properties between the variety of bounded distributive lattices and ${\\\\cal C}$, and a reticulation functor is particularily useful for this transfer. We have defined and studied a reticulation functor for our construction of the reticulation in this context of universal algebra. Hibi conjectured that if a toric ideal has a quadratic Gr\\\\\"obner basis, then the toric ideal has either a lexicographic or a reverse lexicographic quadratic Gr\\\\\"obner basis. In this paper, we present a cut ideal of a graph that serves as a counterexample to this conjecture. We also discuss the existence of a quadratic Gr\\\\\"obner basis of a cut ideal of a cycle. Nagel and Petrovi\\\\\\'c claimed that a cut ideal of a cycle has a lexicographic quadratic Gr\\\\\"obner basis using the results of Chifman and Petrovi\\\\\\'c. However, we point out that the results of Chifman and Petrovi\\\\\\'c used by Nagel and Petrovi\\\\\\'c are incorrect for cycles of length greater than or equal to 6. Hence the existence of a quadratic Gr\\\\\"obner basis for the cut ideal of a cycle (a ring graph) is an open question. We also provide a lexicographic quadratic Gr\\\\\"obner basis of a cut ideal of a cycle of length less than or equal to 7. Let A be a simple, sigma-unital, non-unital C*-algebra, with metrizable tracial simplex T(A), which is projection-surjective and injective and has strict comparison of positive elements by traces. Then the following are equivalent: (i) A has quasicontinuous scale; (ii) The multiplier algebra M(A) has strict comparison of positive elements by traces; (iii) The coronal algebra M(A)/A is purely infinite; (iii\\') The quotient M(A)/Imin is purely infinite; (iv) M(A) has finitely many ideals; (v) Imin=Ifin. If furthermore algebra of n by n matrices of A is projection-surjective and injective for every n, then the above conditions are equivalent to: (vi) the monoid V(M(A)) has finitely many order ideals. Quasicontinuity of the scale is a notion introduced by Kucerovsky and Perera that extends both the property of having finitely many extremal traces and of having continuous scale. Projection-surjectivity and injectivity permit to identify projections in M(A) that are not in A with lower semicontinuous affine functions on T(A). Imin is the smallest ideal of M(A) properly containing A, and Ifin is the ideal of of M(A) generated by the positive elements with evaluation functions finite over the extremal boundary of T(A). Let $A$ and $A_{1}$ are unbounded selfadjoint operators in a Hilbert space $\\\\mathcal{H}$. Following \\\\cite{AK} we call $A_{1}$ a \\\\textit{singular} perturbation of $A$ if $A$ and $A_{1}$ have different domains $\\\\mathcal{D}(A),\\\\mathcal{D}(A_{1})$ but $\\\\mathcal{D}(A)\\\\cap\\\\mathcal{D}(A_{1})$ is dense in $\\\\mathcal{H}$ and $A=A_{1}$ on $\\\\mathcal{D}(A)\\\\cap\\\\mathcal{D}(A_{1})$. In this note we specify without recourse to the theory of selfadjoint extensions of symmetric operators the conditions under which a given bounded holomorphic operator function in the open upper and lower half-planes is the resolvent of a singular perturbation $A_{1}$ of a given selfadjoint operator $A$. For the special case when $A$ is the standardly defined selfadjoint Laplace operator in $\\\\mathbf{L}_{2}(\\\\mathbf{R}_{3})$ we describe using the M.G. Krein resolvent formula a class of singular perturbations $A_{1}$, which are defined by special selfadjoint boundary conditions on a finite or spaced apart by bounded from below distances infinite set of points in $\\\\mathbf{R}_{3}$ and also on a bounded segment of straight line embedded into $\\\\mathbf{R}_{3}$ by connecting parameters in the boundary conditions for $A_{1}$ and the independent on $A$ matrix or operator parameter in the Krein formula for the pair $A, A_{1}$. We develop a likelihood free inference procedure for conditioning a probabilistic model on a predicate. A predicate is a Boolean valued function which expresses a yes/no question about a domain. Our contribution, which we call predicate exchange, constructs a softened predicate which takes value in the unit interval [0, 1] as opposed to a simply true or false. Intuitively, 1 corresponds to true, and a high value (such as 0.999) corresponds to \"nearly true\" as determined by a distance metric. We define Boolean algebra for soft predicates, such that they can be negated, conjoined and disjoined arbitrarily. A softened predicate can serve as a tractable proxy to a likelihood function for approximate posterior inference. However, to target exact inference, we temper the relaxation by a temperature parameter, and add a accept/reject phase use to replica exchange Markov Chain Mont Carlo, which exchanges states between a sequence of models conditioned on predicates at varying temperatures. We describe a lightweight implementation of predicate exchange that it provides a language independent layer that can be implemented on top of existingn modeling formalisms. Given a set $A$ of nonnegative integers, define the sum set $$A+A = \\\\{a_i+a_j\\\\mid a_i,a_j\\\\in A\\\\}$$ and the difference set $$A-A = \\\\{a_i-a_j\\\\mid a_i,a_j\\\\in A\\\\}.$$ The set $A$ is said to be sum-dominant if $|A+A|>|A-A|$. In answering a question by Nathanson, Hegarty used a clever algorithm to find that the smallest cardinality of a sum-dominant set is $8$. Since then, Nathanson has been asking for a human-understandable proof of the result. We offer a computer-free proof that a set of cardinality less than $6$ is not sum-dominant. Furthermore, we prove that the introduction of at most two numbers into a set of numbers in an arithmetic progression does not give a sum-dominant set. This theorem eases several of our proofs and may shed light on future work exploring why a set of cardinality $6$ is not sum-dominant. Finally, we prove that if a set contains a certain number of integers from a specific sequence, then adding a few arbitrary numbers into the set does not give a sum-dominant set. Let $0 < a \\\\le 1/2$ and define the quadrilateral zeta function by $Q(s,a) := \\\\zeta (s,a) + \\\\zeta (s,1-a) + {\\\\rm{Li}} (s,a) + {\\\\rm{Li}} (s,1-a)$, where $\\\\zeta (s,a)$ is the Hurwitz zeta function and ${\\\\rm{Li}} (s,a)$ is the periodic zeta function. In the present paper, we prove that for any $0 < a \\\\le 1/2$, there are positive constants $A(a)$ and $T_0(a)$ such that the numbers of zeros of $Q(s,a)$ on the line segment from $1/2$ to $1/2 +iT$ is at least $A(a) T$ whenever $T \\\\ge T_0(a)$. We also give some remarks on the functional equations of zeta functions related to Hamburger\\'s and Knopp\\'s theorems. It is shown that the category of semi-biproducts in monoids is equivalent to a category of pseudo-actions. A semi-biproduct in monoids is at the same time a generalization of a semi-direct product in groups and a biproduct in commutative monoids. Every Schreier extension of monoids can be seen as an instance of a semi-biproduct; namely a semi-biproduct whose associated pseudo-action has a trivial correction system. A correction system is a new ingredient that must be inserted in order to obtain a pseudo-action out of a pre-action and a factor system. In groups, every correction system is trivial. Hence, semi-biproducts there are the same as semi-direct products with a factor system, which are nothing but group extensions. An attempt to establish a general context in which to define semi-biproducts is made. As a result, a new structure of map-transformations is obtained from a category with a 2-cell structure. Examples and first basic properties are briefly explored. Let $G$ be a finite cyclic group, written additively, and let $A,\\\\ B$ be nonempty subsets of $G$. We will say that $G= A+B$ is a \\\\textit{factorization} if for each $g$ in $G$ there are unique elements $a,\\\\ b$ of $G$ such that $g=a+b, \\\\ a\\\\in A, b\\\\in B$. In particular, if $A$ is a complete set of residues $modulo$ $|A|$, then we call the factorization a \\\\textit{coset factorization} of $G$. In this paper, we mainly study a factorization $G= A+B$, where $G$ is a finite cyclic group and $A=[0,n-k-1]\\\\cup\\\\{i_0,i_1,\\\\ldots i_{k-1}\\\\}$ with $|A|=n$ and $n\\\\geq 2k+1$. We obtain the following conclusion: If $(i)$ $k\\\\leq 2$ or $(ii)$ The number of distinct prime divisors of $gcd(|A|,|B|)$ is at most $1$ or $(iii)$ $gcd(|A|,|B|)=pq$ with $gcd(pq,\\\\frac{|B|}{gcd(|A|,|B|)})=1$, then $A$ is a complete set of residues $modulo$ $n$. It is investigated in what sense the Brouwer fixed point theorem may be viewed as a corollary of the Lawvere fixed point theorem. A suitable generalisation of the Lawvere fixed point theorem is found and a means is identified by which the Brouwer fixed point theorem can be shown to be a corollary, once an appropriate continuous surjective mapping $A\\' \\\\rightarrow X^{A\\'\\'}$ has been constructed for each space $X$ in a certain class of \"nice\" spaces for each one of which the exponential topology on $X^{A\\'\\'}$ exists, and here $A\\'$ and $A\\'\\'$ have the same carrier set and the topology on $A\\'$ is finer than on $A\\'\\'$. It is shown that there is a certain natural way of attempting to derive Brouwer as a corollary of Lawvere which is not possible, that is there is no space $A$ for which the exponential topology on $[0,1]^{A}$ exists and there is a continuous surjection $A \\\\rightarrow [0,1]^{A}$. We then examine the range of contexts in which phenomena like those described in the first result occur, from a broadly model-theoretic perspective, with a view towards applications for the original motivation for the problem as a problem in decision theory for AI systems, suggested by the Machine Intelligence Research Institute. The following is a thermodynamic analysis of a III order (and some aspects of a IV order) phase transition. Such a transition can occur in a superconductor if the normal state is a diamagnet. The equation for a phase boundary in an H-T (H is the magnetic field, T, the temperature) plane is derived. by considering two possible forms of the gradient energy, it is possible to construct a field theory which describes a III or a IV order transition and permits a study of thermal fluctuations and inhomogeneous order parameters. We study the liquid-solid transition in a collection of interacting particles moving through a dissipative medium under the action of a constant, spatially uniform external force, e.g. a charge-stabilized suspension in a fluidized bed or a flux-point lattice moving through a thin, current-carrying slab of type II superconductor. The mobility of a given region in these systems is in general a function of the local concentration. We show that the structure factor peak is suppressed in an anisotropic manner as a result of this effect, resulting in a shift of the crystal-liquid phase boundary towards the crystal side. A nonequilibrium phase diagram is presented. A novel form of Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in the cuprates can be reinterpreted as a conventional JT effect on a lattice with a larger unit cell. There is a triplet of instabilities, parametrized by a pseudospin, consisting of a form of the low-temperature tetragonal phase, a charge density wave phase, and a flux phase (orbital antiferromagnet). On a single 4-Cu plaquette, the problem is of E x (b_1+b_2) form. For a special choice of parameters, the model supports a dynamic JT effect, but is classically chaotic. The connection of this phase with Berryonic matter is discussed. We analyze a model of a nonlinear bath consisting of a single two-level system coupled to a linear bath (a classical noise force in the limit considered here). This allows us to study the effects of a nonlinear, non-Markoffian bath in a particularly simple situation. We analyze the effects of this bath onto the dynamics of a spin by calculating the decay of the equilibrium correlator of the spin\\'s z-component. The exact results are compared with those obtained using three commonly used approximations: a Markoffian master equation for the spin dynamics, a weak-coupling approximation, and the substitution of a linear bath for the original nonlinear bath. Truncated Levy flights are stochastic processes which display a crossover from a heavy-tailed Levy behavior to a faster decaying probability distribution function (pdf). Putting less weight on long flights overcomes the divergence of the Levy distribution second moment. We introduce a fractional generalization of the diffusion equation, whose solution defines a process in which a Levy flight of exponent alpha is truncated by a power-law of exponent 5 - alpha. A closed form for the characteristic function of the process is derived. The pdf of the displacement slowly converges to a Gaussian in its central part showing however a power law far tail. Possible applications are discussed. We investigate the zero temperature structure of a crystalline monolayer constrained to lie on a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold with variable Gaussian curvature and boundary. A full analytical treatment is presented for the case of a paraboloid of revolution. Using the geometrical theory of topological defects in a continuum elastic background we find that the presence of a variable Gaussian curvature, combined with the additional constraint of a boundary, gives rise to a rich variety of phenomena beyond that known for spherical crystals. We also provide a numerical analysis of a system of classical particles interacting via a Coulomb potential on the surface of a paraboloid. In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework for automated bug localization. This framework can be briefly summarized as follows. A program execution can be represented as a rooted acyclic directed graph. We define an execution snapshot by a cut-set on the graph. A program state can be regarded as a conjunction of labels on edges in a cut-set. Then we argue that a debugging task is a pruning process of the execution graph by using cut-sets. A pruning algorithm, i.e., a debugging task, is also presented. We describe a novel design for an intense source of slow positrons based on pair production with a beam of electrons from a 10 MeV accelerator hitting a thin target at a low incidence angle. The positrons are collected with a set of coils adapted to the large production angle. The collection system is designed to inject the positrons in a Greaves-Surko trap [1]. Such a source could be the basis for a series of experiments in fundamental and applied research and would also be a prototype source for industrial applications which concern the field of defect characterization in the nanometer scale. Let $G$ be a semisimple Lie group, ${\\\\frak g}$ its Lie algebra. For any symmetric space $M$ over $G$ we construct a new (deformed) multiplication in the space $A$ of smooth functions on $M$. This multiplication is invariant under the action of the Drinfeld--Jimbo quantum group $U_h{\\\\frak g}$ and is commutative with respect to an involutive operator $\\\\tilde{S}: A\\\\otimes A \\\\to A\\\\otimes A$. Such a multiplication is unique. Let $M$ be a k\\\\\"{a}hlerian symmetric space with the canonical Poisson structure. Then we construct a $U_h{\\\\frak g}$-invariant multiplication in $A$ which depends on two parameters and is a quantization of that structure. We study a topological sigma-model ($A$-model) in the case when the target space is an ($m_0|m_1$)-dimensional supermanifold. We prove under certain conditions that such a model is equivalent to an $A$-model having an ($m_0-m_1$)-dimensional manifold as a target space. We use this result to prove that in the case when the target space of $A$-model is a complete intersection in a toric manifold, this $A$-model is equivalent to an $A$-model having a toric supermanifold as a target space. By dimensional reduction of a massive supersymmetric B$\\\\wedge $F theory, a manifestly N=1 supersymmetric completion of a massive antisymmetric tensor gauge theory is constructed in (2+1) dimensions. In the N=1-D=3 superspace, a new topological term is used to give mass for the Kalb-Ramond field. We have introduced a massive gauge invariant model using the Stuckelberg formalism and an abelian topologically massive theory for the Kalb-Ramond superfield. An equivalence of both massive models is suggested. Further, a component field analysis is performed, showing a second supersymmetry in the model. In a previous paper the second author introduced a compact topology on the space of closed ideals of a unital Banach algebra A. If A is separable then this topology is either metrizable or else neither Hausdorff nor first countable. Here it is shown that this topology is Hausdorff if A is the algebra of once continuously differentiable functions on an interval, but that if A is a uniform algebra then this topology is Hausdorff if and only if A has spectral synthesis. An example is given of a strongly regular, uniform algebra for which every maximal ideal has a bounded approximate identity, but which does not have spectral synthesis. We show that a graded commutative algebra A with any square zero odd differential operator is a natural generalization of a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra. While such an operator of order 2 defines a Gerstenhaber (Lie) algebra structure on A, an operator of an order higher than 2 (Koszul-Akman definition) leads to the structure of a strongly homotopy Lie algebra (L$_\\\\infty$-algebra) on A. This allows us to give a definition of a Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra up to homotopy. We also make a conjecture which is a generalization of the formality theorem of Kontsevich to the Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra level. In this paper we investigate the extremal richness of the multiplier algebra $M(A)$ and the corona algebra $M(A)/A$, for a simple C*-algebra $A$ with real rank zero and stable rank one. We show that the space of extremal quasitraces and the scale of $A$ contain enough information to determine whether $M(A)/A$ is extremally rich. In detail, if the scale is finite, then $M(A)/A$ is extremally rich. In important cases, and if the scale is not finite, extremal richness is characterized by a restrictive condition: the existence of only one infinite extremal quasitrace which is isolated in a convex sense. Let $A$ be a separable $C^*$-algebra and let $B$ be a stable $C^*$-algebra with a strictly positive element. We consider the (semi)group $\\\\Ext^{as}(A,B)$ (resp. $\\\\Ext(A,B)$) of homotopy classes of asymptotic (resp. of genuine) homomorphisms from $A$ to the corona algebra $M(B)/B$ and the natural map $i:\\\\Ext(A,B)\\\\ar\\\\Ext^{as}(A,B)$. We show that if $A$ is a suspension then $\\\\Ext^{as}(A,B)$ coincides with $E$-theory of Connes and Higson and the map $i$ is surjective. In particular any asymptotic homomorphism from $SA$ to $M(B)/B$ is homotopic to some genuine homomorphism. Let $A$ be a star product on a symplectic manifold $(M,\\\\omega_0)$, $\\\\frac{1}{t}[\\\\omega]$ its Fedosov class, where $\\\\omega$ is a deformation of $\\\\omega_0$. We prove that for a complex polarization of $\\\\omega$ there exists a commutative subalgebra, $O$, in $A$ that is isomorphic to the algebra of functions constant along the polarization. Let $F(A)$ consists of elements of $A$ whose commutator with $O$ belongs to $O$. Then, $F(A)$ is a Lie algebra which is an $O$-extension of the Lie algebra of derivations of $O$. We prove a formula which relates the class of this extension, the Fedosov class, and the Chern class of $P$. Theorem: If W is a smooth complex projective variety with h^1 (O-script_W) = 0, then a sufficiently ample smooth divisor X on W cannot be a hyperplane section of a Calabi-Yau variety, unless W is itself a Calabi-Yau. Corollary: A smooth hypersurface of degree d in P^n (n >= 2) is a hyperplane section of a Calabi-Yau variety iff n+2 <= d <= 2n+2. The method is to construct out of the variety W a universal family of all varieties Z for which X is a hyperplane section with normal bundle K_X, and examine the \"bad\" singularities of such Z. A motivation is to show many curves cannot be divisors on a K-3 surface. A homoclinic class of a vector field is the closure of the transverse homoclinic orbits associated to a hyperbolic periodic orbit. An attractor (a repeller) is a transitive set to which converges every positive (negative) nearby orbit. We show that a generic C1 vector field on a closed n-manifold has either infinitely many homoclinic classes or a finite collection of attractors (repellers) whose basins form an open-dense set. This result gives an approach to a conjecture by Palis. We also prove the existence of a locally residual subset of C1 vector fields on a 5-manifold having finitely many attractors and repellers but infinitely many homoclinic classes. A coaction d of a locally compact group G on a C*-algebra A is maximal if a certain natural map from A times_d G times_{d hat} G onto A otimes K(L^2(G)) is an isomorphism. All dual coactions on full crossed products by group actions are maximal; a discrete coaction is maximal if and only if A is the full cross-sectional algebra of the corresponding Fell bundle. For every nondegenerate coaction of G on A, there is a maximal coaction of G on an extension of A such that the quotient map induces an isomorphism of the crossed products. A criterion to determine the L-S category of a total space of a sphere-bundle over a sphere is given in terms of homotopy invariants of its characteristic map, and thus providing a complete answer to Ganea\\'s Problem 4. As a result, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for such a total space $N$ to have the same L-S category as its `once punctured submanifold\\' $N\\\\smallsetminus\\\\{P\\\\}$, $P \\\\in N$. Also a necessary condition for such a total space $M$ to satisfy Ganea\\'s conjecture is obtained. A dual approach to defining the triangle sequence (a type of multidimensional continued fraction algorithm, initially developed in NT/9906016) for a pair of real numbers is presented, providing a new, clean geometric interpretation of the triangle sequence. We give a new criterion for when a triangle sequence uniquely describes a pair of numbers and give the first explicit examples of triangle sequences that do not uniquely describe a pair of reals. Finally, this dual approach yields that the triangle sequence is topologically strongly mixing, meaning in particular that it is topologically ergodic. Generally, in any human field, a Smarandache Structure on a set A means a weak structure W on A such that there exists a proper subset B which is embedded with a stronger structure S. By a proper subset one understands a set included in A, different from the empty set, from the unit element if any, and from A. These types of structures occur in our every day\\'s life, that\\'s why we study them in this book. Thus, as a particular case, we investigate the theory of linear algebra and Smarandache linear algebra. We define a 2-normal surface to be one which intersects every 3-simplex of a triangulated 3-manifold in normal triangles and quadrilaterals, with one or two exceptions. The possible exceptions are a pair of octagons, a pair of unknotted tubes, an octagon and a tube, or a 12-gon. In this paper we use the theory of critical surfaces developed in earlier work to prove the existence of topologically interesting 2-normal surfaces. Our main results are (1) if a ball with normal boundary in a triangulated 3-manifold contains two almost normal 2-spheres then it contains a 2-normal 2-sphere and (2) in a non-Haken 3-manifold with a given triangulation the minimal genus common stabilization of any pair of strongly irreducible Heegaard splittings can be isotoped to an almost normal or a 2-normal surface. In a paper by the authors, the associative and the Lie algebras of Weyl type $A[D]=A\\\\otimes F[D]$ were introduced, where $A$ is a commutative associative algebra with an identity element over a field $F$ of any characteristic, and $F[D]$ is the polynomial algebra of a commutative derivation subalgebra $D$ of $A$. In the present paper, a class of the above associative and Lie algebras $A[D]$ with $F$ being a field of characteristic 0 and $D$ consisting of locally finite derivations of $A$, is studied. The isomorphism classes of these associative and Lie algebras are determined. The structure of these algebras is described explicitly. A family $\\\\BA_\\\\a$ of differential operators depending on a real parameter $\\\\a$ is considered. The problem can be formulated in the language of perturbation theory of quadratic forms. The perturbation is only relatively bounded but not relatively compact with respect to the unperturbed form. The spectral properties of the operator $\\\\BA_\\\\a$ strongly depend on $\\\\a$. In particular, for $\\\\a<\\\\sqrt2$ the spectrum of $\\\\BA_\\\\a$ below 1/2 is finite, while for $\\\\a>\\\\sqrt2$ the operator has no eigenvalues at all. We study the asymptotic behaviour of the number of eigenvalues as $\\\\a\\\\nearrow\\\\sqrt2$. We reduce this problem to the one on the spectral asymptotics for a certain Jacobi matrix. Let $A$ be a commutative comodule algebra over a commutative bialgebra $H$. The group of invertible relative Hopf modules maps to the Picard group of $A$, and the kernel is described as a quotient group of the group of invertible grouplike elements of the coring $A\\\\ot H$, or as a Harrison cohomology group. Our methods are based on elementary $K$-theory. The Hilbert 90 Theorem follows as a corollary. The part of the Picard group of the coinvariants that becomes trivial after base extension embeds in the Harrison cohomology group, and the image is contained in a well-defined subgroup $E$. It equals $E$ if $H$ is a cosemisimple Hopf algebra over a field. We consider the following problem. Suppose $\\\\alpha$ is an action of a locally compact group $G$ on a $C^*$-algebra $A$, $H$ is a closed subgroup of $G$, and $(\\\\pi,U)$ is a covariant representation of $(A,H,\\\\alpha)$. For which closed subgroups $K$ containing $H$ is there a covariant representation $(\\\\pi,V)$ of $(A,K,\\\\alpha)$ such that $V|_H=U$? We answer this problem by providing a criterion involving the induced representation of $(A,G,\\\\alpha)$. We then consider the dual problem for coactions of locally compact groups. Assume that $Au=f,\\\\quad (1)$ is a solvable linear equation in a Hilbert space $H$, $A$ is a linear, closed, densely defined, unbounded operator in $H$, which is not boundedly invertible, so problem (1) is ill-posed. It is proved that the closure of the operator $(A^*A+\\\\a I)^{-1}A^*$, with the domain $D(A^*)$, where $\\\\a>0$ is a constant, is a linear bounded everywhere defined operator with norm $\\\\leq 1$. This result is applied to the variational problem $F(u):= ||Au-f||^2+\\\\a ||u||^2=min$, where $f$ is an arbitrary element of $H$, not necessarily belonging to the range of $A$. Variational regularization of problem (1) is constructed, and a discrepancy principle is proved. Let A be a domain of the boundary of a strictly pseudoconvex domain \\\\Omega of C^n and M a smooth, closed, maximally complex submanifold of A. We find a subdomain \\\\widetilde A of \\\\Omega, depending only on \\\\Omega and A, and a complex subvariety W of \\\\widetilde A such that bW\\\\cap A = M. Moreover, a generalization to analytic sets of depth at least 4 is given. Let $X$ be a left introverted subspace of dual of a Banach algebra. We study $Z_t(X^*),$ the topological center of Banach algebra $X^*$. We fined the topological center of $(X\\\\cA)^*$, when $\\\\cA$ has a bounded right approximate identity and $\\\\cA\\\\subseteq X^*.$ So we introduce a new notation of amenability for a dual Banach algebra $\\\\cal A$. A dual Banach algebra $\\\\cal A$ is weakly Connes-amenable if the first $weak^*-$continuous cohomology group of $\\\\cal A$ with coefficients in $\\\\cal A$ is zero; i.e., $H^1_{w^*}(\\\\cal A, \\\\cal A)=\\\\{o\\\\}$. We study the weak Connes-amenability of some dual Banach algebras. Garside groupoids, as recently introduced by Krammer, generalise Garside groups. A weak Garside group is a group that is equivalent as a category to a Garside groupoid. We show that any periodic loop in a Garside groupoid $\\\\CG$ may be viewed as a Garside element for a certain Garside structure on another Garside groupoid $\\\\CG_m$, which is equivalent as a category to $\\\\CG$. As a consequence, the centraliser of a periodic element in a weak Garside group is a weak Garside group. Our main tool is the notion of divided Garside categories, an analog for Garside categories of B\\\\\"okstedt-Hsiang-Madsen\\'s subdivisions of Connes\\' cyclic category. This tool is used in our separate proof of the $K(\\\\pi,1)$ property for complex reflection arrangements In this paper we investigate the Lie structure of the Lie superalgebra K of skew elements of a semiprime associative superalgebra A with superinvolution. We show that if U is a Lie ideal of K, then either there exists an ideal J of A such that a determined nonzero Lie ideal connected with J is contained in U, or A is a subdirect sum of A\\', A\\'\\', where the image of U in A\\' is central, and A\\'\\' is a subdirect product of orders in simple superalgebras, each at most 16-dimensional over its center. Often some interesting or simply curious points are left out when developing a theory. It seems that one of them is the existence of an upper bound for the fraction of area of a convex and closed plane area lying outside a circle with which it shares a diameter, a problem stemming from the theory of isoperimetric inequalities. In this paper such a bound is constructed and shown to be attained for a particular area. It is also shown that convexity is a necessary condition in order to avoid the whole area lying outside the circle. We offer a new method of reduction for a system of point vortices on a plane and a sphere. This method is similar to the classical node elimination procedure. However, as applied to the vortex dynamics, it requires substantial modification. Reduction of four vortices on a sphere is given in more detail. We also use the Poincare surface-of-section technique to perform the reduction a four-vortex system on a sphere. In the framework of on-line learning, a learning machine might move around a teacher due to the differences in structures or output functions between the teacher and the learning machine or due to noises. The generalization performance of a new student supervised by a moving machine has been analyzed. A model composed of a true teacher, a moving teacher and a student that are all linear perceptrons with noises has been treated analytically using statistical mechanics. It has been proven that the generalization errors of a student can be smaller than that of a moving teacher, even if the student only uses examples from the moving teacher. Formulas for the corrections to the energy levels and wave functions of a spin-zero particle bound in a strong field are derived. General case of the sum of a Lorentz-scalar potential and zero component of a Lorentz-vector potential is considered. The forms of the corrections differ essentially from those for spin-1/2 particles. As an example of application of our results, we evaluated the electric polarizability of a ground state of a spin-zero particle bound in a strong Coulomb field. A mirror in vacuum is coupled to fluctuating quantum fields. As a result, its energy-momentum and mass fluctuate. We compute the correlation spectra of force and mass fluctuations for a mirror at rest in vacuum (of a scalar field in a two-dimensional space-time). The obtained expressions agree with a mass correction equal to a vacuum energy stored by the mirror. We introduce a Lagrangian model which consistently describes a scalar field coupled to a scatterer, with inertial mass being a quantum variable. Two types of particles, A and B with their corresponding antiparticles, are defined in a one dimensional cyclic lattice with an odd number of sites. In each step of time evolution, each particle acts as a source for the polarization field of the other type of particle with nonlocal action but with an effect decreasing with the distance: A -->...\\\\bar{B} B \\\\bar{B} B \\\\bar{B} ... ; B --> A \\\\bar{A} A \\\\bar{A} A ... . It is shown that the combined distribution of these particles obeys the time evolution of a free particle as given by quantum mechanics. A two-photon Fock state is prepared in a cavity sustaining a \"source mode \" and a \"target mode\", with a single circular Rydberg atom. In a third-order Raman process, the atom emits a photon in the target while scattering one photon from the source into the target. The final two-photon state is probed by measuring by Ramsey interferometry the cavity light shifts induced by the target field on the same atom. Extensions to other multi-photon processes and to a new type of micromaser are briefly discussed. This note presents a simple formula for the average fidelity between a unitary quantum gate and a general quantum operation on a qudit, generalizing the formula for qubits found by Bowdrey et al [Phys. Lett. A 294, 258 (2002)]. This formula may be useful for experimental determination of average gate fidelity. We also give a simplified proof of a formula due to Horodecki et al [Phys. Rev. A 60, 1888 (1999)], connecting average gate fidelity to entanglement fidelity. A method for measuring an integral of a classical field via local interaction of a single quantum particle in a superposition of 2^N states is presented. The method is as efficient as a quantum method with N qubits passing through the field one at a time and it is exponentially better than any known classical method that uses N bits passing through the field one at a time. A related method for searching a string with a quantum particle is proposed. We study how a coupled array of spiking chaotic systems synchronizes to an external driving in a short time. Synchronization means spike separation at adjacent sites much shorter than the average inter-spike interval; a local lack of synchronization is called a defect. The system displays sudden spontaneous defect disappearance at a critical coupling strength. Below critical coupling, the system reaches order at a definite amplitude of an external input; this order persists for a fixed time slot. Thus, the array behaves as an excitable system, even though the single element lacks such a property. The above features provide a dynamical explanation of feature binding in perceptual tasks. Let A be a C*-algebra and I a closed two-sided ideal of A. We use the Hilbert C*-modules picture of the Cuntz semigroup to investigate the relations between the Cuntz semigroups of I, A and A/I. We obtain a relation on two elements of the Cuntz semigroup of A that characterizes when they are equal in the Cuntz semigroup of A/I. As a corollary, we show that the Cuntz semigroup functor is exact. Replacing the Cuntz equivalence relation of Hilbert modules by their isomorphism, we obtain a generalization of Kasparov\\'s Stabilization theorem. Let $A$ be an elliptic operator on a compact manifold with boundary $M$, and let $\\\\wp : \\\\partial\\\\M \\\\to Y$ be a covering map, where $Y$ is a closed manifold. Let $A_C$ be a realization of $A$ subject to a coupling condition $C$ that is elliptic with parameter in the sector $\\\\Lambda$. By a coupling condition we mean a nonlocal boundary condition that respects the covering structure of the boundary. We prove that the resolvent trace $\\\\Tr_{L^2} (A_C-\\\\lambda)^{-N}$ for $N$ sufficiently large has a complete asymptotic expansion as $|\\\\lambda| \\\\to \\\\infty$, $\\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\Lambda$. In particular, the heat trace $\\\\Tr_{L^2}e^{-tA_C}$ has a complete asymptotic expansion as $t \\\\to 0^+$, and the $\\\\zeta$-function has a meromorphic extension to $\\\\C$. Fractional derivative can be defined as a fractional power of derivative. The commutator (i/h)[H, ], which is used in the Heisenberg equation, is a derivation on a set of observables. A derivation is a map that satisfies the Leibnitz rule. In this paper, we consider a fractional derivative on a set of quantum observables as a fractional power of the commutator (i/h)[H, ]. As a result, we obtain a fractional generalization of the Heisenberg equation. The fractional Heisenberg equation is exactly solved for the Hamiltonians of free particle and harmonic oscillator. The suggested Heisenberg equation generalize a notion of quantum Hamiltonian systems to describe quantum dissipative processes. The steady state reached by a system of particles sliding down a fluctuating surface has interesting properties. Particle clusters form and break rapidly, leading to a broad distribution of sizes and large fluctuations. The density-density correlation function is a singular scaling function of the separation and system size. A simple mapping is shown to take a configuration of sliding hard-core particles with mutual exclusion (a system which shows a cusp singularity) to a configuration with multiparticle occupancy. For the mapped system, a calculation of the correlation function shows that it is of the same scaling form again, but with a stronger singularity (a divergence) of the sort observed earlier for noninteracting passive particles. We investigate the perfect derived category dgPer(A) of a positively graded differential graded (dg) algebra A whose degree zero part is a dg subalgebra and semisimple as a ring. We introduce an equivalent subcategory of dgPer(A) whose objects are easy to describe, define a t-structure on dgPer(A) and study its heart. We show that dgPer(A) is a Krull-Remak-Schmidt category. Then we consider the heart in the case that A is a Koszul ring with differential zero satisfying some finiteness conditions. We consider finitely presented,residually finite groups $G$ and finitely generated normal subgroups $A$ such that the inclusion $A\\\\hookrightarrow G$ induces an isomorphism from the profinite completion of $A$ to a direct factor of the profinite completion of $G$. We explain why $A$ need not be a direct factor of a subgroup of finite index in $G$; indeed $G$ need not have a subgroup of finite index that splits as a non-trivial direct product. We prove that there is no algorithm that can determine whether $A$ is a direct factor of a subgroup of finite index in $G$. Using a smooth triangulation and a Riemannian metric on a compact, connected, closed manifold M of dimension n we have got that every such M can be represented as a union of a n-dimensional cell and a connected union K of some subsimplexes of the triangulation. A sufficiently small closed neighborhood of K is called a geometric black hole. Any smooth tensor field T (or other structure) can be deformed into a continuous and sectionally smooth tensor field T1 where T1 has a very simple construction out of the black hole. We explore a somewhat unexpected connection between knot Floer homology and shellable posets, via grid diagrams. Given a grid presentation of a knot K inside S^3, we define a poset which has an associated chain complex whose homology is the knot Floer homology of K. We then prove that the closed intervals of this poset are shellable. This allows us to combinatorially associate a PL flow category to a grid diagram. A numeral system is a sequence of an infinite different closed normal $\\\\lambda$-terms which has closed $\\\\lambda$-terms for successor and zero test. A numeral system is said adequate iff it has a closed $\\\\lambda$-term for predecessor. A storage operator for a numeral system is a closed $\\\\lambda$-term which simulate \"call-by-value\" in the context of a \"call-by-name\" strategy. E. Tronci conjectured the following result : a numeral system is adequate if it has a storage operator. This paper gives a negative answer to this conjecture for the numeral systems typable in the J.-Y. Girard type system F. The E. Tronci\\'s conjecture remains open in pure $\\\\lambda$-calculus. Motivated by a question of S\\\\\\'ark\\\\\"ozy, we study the gaps in the product sequence $\\\\B=\\\\A ... \\\\A=\\\\{b_n=a_ia_j, a_i,a_j\\\\in \\\\A\\\\}$ when $\\\\A$ has upper Banach density $\\\\alpha>0$. We prove that there are infinitely many gaps $b_{n+1}-b_n\\\\ll \\\\alpha^{-3}$ and that for $t\\\\ge2$ there are infinitely many $t$-gaps $b_{n+t}-b_{n}\\\\ll t^2\\\\alpha^{-4}$. Furthermore we prove that these estimates are best possible. We also discuss a related question about the cardinality of the quotient set $\\\\A/\\\\A=\\\\{a_i/a_j, a_i,a_j\\\\in \\\\A\\\\}$ when $\\\\A\\\\subset\\\\{1,..., N\\\\}$ and $|\\\\A|=\\\\alpha N$. The path-spin entangled state of a single spin-1/2 particle is considered which is generated by using a beam-spitter and a spin-flipper. Using this hybrid entanglement at the level of a single particle as a resource, we formulate a protocol for transferring of the state of an unknown qubit to a distant location. Our scheme is implemented by a sequence of unitary operations along with suitable spin-measurements, as well as by using classical communication between the two spatially separated parties. This protocol, thus, demonstrates the possibility of using intraparticle entanglement as a physical resource for performing information theoretic tasks. We define radix representations for vectors in Z^n analogously with radix representations in Z, and give a sufficient condition for a matrix A:Z^n -> Z^n to yield a radix representation with a given canonical digit set. We relate our results to a sufficient condition given recently by Jeong. We also show that any expanding matrix A:Z^n -> Z^n will not be too far from yielding a radix representation, in that we can partition Z^n into a finite number of sets such that A yields a radix representation on each set up to translation by (A^N)s for some vector s (N >= 0 will vary). We call the vectors s \"pseudodigits\", and call this decomposition of Z^n a \"pseudodigit representation\". Property A was introduced by Yu as a non-equivariant analogue of amenability. Nigel Higson posed the question of whether there is a homological characterisation of property A. In this paper we answer Higson\\'s question affirmatively by constructing analogues of group cohomology and bounded cohomology for a metric space X, and show that property A is equivalent to vanishing cohomology. Using these cohomology theories we also give a characterisation of property A in terms of the existence of an asymptotically invariant mean on the space. State readout is a key requirement for a quantum computer. For semiconductor-based qubit devices it is usually accomplished using a separate mesoscopic electrometer. Here we demonstrate a simple detection scheme in which a radio-frequency resonant circuit coupled to a semiconductor double quantum dot is used to probe its charge and spin states. These results demonstrate a new non-invasive technique for measuring charge and spin states in quantum dot systems without requiring a separate mesoscopic detector. A classical formula of Allwright on the general solution of a scalar differential equation is generalized to a system of differential equations by means of the Kronecker product.The Allwright formula is connected with the Riccati equation, and in a similar way the generalized formula is connected with a special type of a differential system called a vector Riccati equation. Moreover,the classical result that a scalar differential equation is a Riccati equation if and only if its general solution is a fractional linear function of the starting value, is also generalized to a differential system. The Kelmans-Seymour conjecture states that the 5-connected nonplanar graphs contain a subdivided $K_{_5}$. Certain questions of Mader propose a \"plan\" towards a possible resolution of this conjecture. One part of this plan is to show that a 5-connected nonplanar graph containing $K^-_{_4}$ or $K_{_{2,3}}$ as a subgraph has a subdivided $K_{_5}$. Recently, Ma and Yu showed that a 5-connected nonplanar graph containing $K^-_{_4}$ as a subgraph has a subdivided $K_{_5}$. We take interest in $K_{_{2,3}}$ and prove that a 5-connected nonplanar apex graph containing $K_{_{2,3}}$ as a subgraph has a subdivided $K_{_5}$ The evolution of a modulated positron beam in a planar crystal channel is investigated within the diffusion approach. A detailed description of the formalism is given. A new parameter, the demodulation length, is introduced, representing the quantitative measure of the depth at which the channelling beam preserves its modulation in the crystal. It is demonstrated that there exist crystal channels with the demodulation length sufficiently large for using the crystalline undulator as a coherent source of hard X rays. This finding is a crucial milestone in developing a new type of lasers radiating in the hard X ray and gamma ray range. It has been shown that the use of a bent crystal with a variable curvature radius makes it possible to reduce the fraction of dechanneled particles by an order of magnitude. This effect enables the strong reduction of the particle density at the edge of a collimator or the partition of a septum upon the multiturn extraction of a beam from a ring accelerator. In particular, the beam extraction efficiency at the U-70 synchrotron and Large Hadron Collider can be increased to 95 and 99.65%, respectively. We consider a case where a weak value is introduced as a physical quantity rather than an average of weak measurements. The case we treat is a time evolution of a particle by 1+1 dimensional Dirac equation. Particularly in a spontaneous pair production via a supercritical step potential, a quantitative explanation can be given by a weak value for the group velocity of the particle. We also show the condition for the pair production (supercriticality) corresponds to the condition when the weak value takes a strange value (superluminal velocity). Let $A$ be a $\\\\nu$-vector of self-adjoint, pairwise commuting operators and $B$ a bounded operator of class $C^{n_0}(A)$. We prove a Taylor-like expansion of the commutator $[B,f(A)]$ for a large class of functions $f\\\\colon\\\\mathbm{R}^\\\\nu \\\\to \\\\mathbm{R}$, generalising the one-dimensional result where $A$ is just a self-adjoint operator. This is done using almost analytic extensions and the higher-dimensional Helffer-Sj\\\\\"ostrand formula. A locally conformally K\\\\\"ahler (LCK) manifold is a complex manifold covered by a K\\\\\"ahler manifold, with the covering group acting by homotheties. We show that if such a compact manifold X admits a holomorphic submersion with positive dimensional fibers at least one of which is of K\\\\\"ahler type, then X is globally conformally K\\\\\"ahler or biholomorphic, up to finite covers, to a Vaisman manifold (i.e. a mapping torus over a circle, with Sasakian fibre). As a consequence, we show that the product between a compact non-K\\\\\"ahler LCK and a compact K\\\\\"ahler manifold cannot carry a LCK metric. We associate to a localizable module a left retraction of algebras; it is a homological ring epimorphism that preserves singularity categories. We study the behavior of left retractions with respect to Gorenstein homological properties (for example, being Gorenstein algebras or CM-free). We apply the results to Nakayama algebras. It turns out that for a connected Nakayama algebra $A$, there exists a connected self-injective Nakayama algebra $A\\'$ such that there is a sequence of left retractions linking $A$ to $A\\'$; in particular, the singularity category of $A$ is triangle equivalent to the stable category of $A\\'$. We classify connected Nakayama algebras with at most three simple modules according to Gorenstein homological properties. We propose and demonstrate a concept that mimics the magnetization of the heavy dust particles in a complex plasma while leaving the properties of the light species practically unaffected. It makes use of the frictional coupling between a complex plasma and the neutral gas, which allows to transfer angular momentum from a rotating gas column to a well-controlled rotation of the dust cloud. This induces a Coriolis force that acts exactly as the Lorentz force in a magnetic field. Experimental normal mode measurements for a small dust cluster with four particles show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions for a magnetized plasma. Let $A$ be an infinite set. Let $\\\\Omega(A)$ be the algebra over $A$ where every constant is a fundamental constant and every finitary function is a fundamental operation. We shall give a method of representing any algebra $\\\\mathcal{L}$ in the variety generated by $\\\\Omega(A)$ as limit reduced powers and even direct limits of limit reduced powers of $\\\\mathcal{L}$. If the algebra $\\\\mathcal{L}$ is elementarily equivalent to $\\\\Omega(A)$, then this construction represents $\\\\Omega(A)$ as a limit ultrapower and also as direct limits of limit ultrapowers of $\\\\Omega(A)$. This method therefore gives a method of representing Boolean ultrapowers and other generalizations of the ultrapower construction as limit ultrapowers and direct limits of limit ultrapowers. Green and Ruzsa recently proved that for any $s\\\\ge2$, any small squaring set $A$ in a (multiplicative) abelian group, i.e. $|A\\\\cdot A|<K|A|$, has a Freiman $s$-model: it means that there exists a group $G$ and a Freiman $s$-isomorphism from $A$ into $G$ such that $|G|<f(s,K)|A|$. In an unpublished note, Green proved that such a result does not necessarily hold in non abelian groups if $s\\\\ge64$. The aim of this paper is improve Green\\'s result by showing that it remains true under the weaker assumption $s\\\\ge6$. We investigate a double extension to the Standard Model (SM). A first extension introduces, via minimal coupling, a massive $Z\\'$ boson. This enlarged SM is coupled to a dark matter sector through the Stueckelberg mechanism by a $A\\'$ boson. However, the $A\\'$ boson does not interact directly with the SM fermions. In our study, we found that the $A\\'$ is a massless photon-like particle in dark sector. Constraints on the mass for $Z\\'$ and corrections to $Z$ mass are obtained. The uniform norm on a uniform normed Q-algebra is the only uniform Q-algebra norm on it. The uniform norm on a regular uniform normed Q-algebra with unit is the only uniform norm on it. Let A be a uniform topological algebra whose spectrum M (A) is equicontinuous, then A is a uniform normed algebra. Let A be a regular semisimple commutative Banach algebra, then every algebra norm on A is a Q-algebra norm on A. For a regular multiplier Hopf algebra $A$, the Yetter-Drinfel\\'d module category ${}_{A}\\\\mathcal{YD}^{A}$ is equivalent to the centre $Z({}_{A}\\\\mathcal{M})$ of the unital left $A$-module category ${}_{A}\\\\mathcal{M}$. Then we introduce the generalized $(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta)$-Yetter-Drinfel\\'d module categories ${}_{A}\\\\mathcal{GYD}^{A}(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta)$, which are treated as components of a braided $T$-category. Especially when $A$ is a coFrobenius Hopf algebra, ${}_{A}\\\\mathcal{YD}^{A}(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta)$ is isomorphic to the unital $\\\\hat{A} \\\\bowtie A(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta)$-module category ${}_{\\\\hat{A} \\\\bowtie A(\\\\alpha, \\\\beta)}\\\\mathcal{M}$. Finally for a Yetter-Drinfel\\'d $A$-module algebra $H$, we introduce Yetter-Drinfel\\'d $(H, A)$-module category, which is a monoidal. A subalgebra $A$ of the algebra $B(\\\\mathcal{H})$ of bounded linear operators on a separable Hilbert space $\\\\mathcal{H}$ is said to be catalytic if every transitive subalgebra $\\\\mathcal{T}\\\\subset B(\\\\mathcal{H})$ containing it is strongly dense. We show that for a hypo-Dirichlet or logmodular algebra, $A=H^{\\\\infty}(m)$ acting on a generalized Hardy space $H^{2}(m)$ for a representing measure $m$ that defines a reproducing kernel Hilbert space is catalytic. For the case of a nice finitely-connected domain, we show that the \"holomorphic functions\" of a bundle shift yields a catalytic algebra, thus generalize a result of Bercovici, Foias, Pearcy and the first author[7]. We investigate the non-linear dynamics of a two-dimensional film flowing down a finite heater, for a non-volatile and a volatile liquid. An oscillatory instability is predicted beyond a critical value of Marangoni number using linear stability theory. Continuation along the Marangoni number using non-linear evolution equation is used to trace bifurcation diagram associated with the oscillatory instability. Hysteresis, a characteristic attribute of a sub-critical Hopf bifurcation, is observed in a critical parametric region. The bifurcation is universally observed for both, a non-volatile film and a volatile film. For given positive integers $n$ and $a$, let $R(n;\\\\,a)$ denote the number of positive integer solutions $(x,\\\\,y)$ of the Diophantine equation $$ {a\\\\over n}={1\\\\over x}+{1\\\\over y}. $$ Write $$ S(N;\\\\,a)=\\\\sum_{\\\\substack{n\\\\leq N (n,\\\\,a)=1}}R(n;\\\\,a). $$ Recently Jingjing Huang and R. C. Vaughan proved that for $4\\\\leq N$ and $a\\\\leq 2N$, there is an asymptotic formula $$ S(N;\\\\,a)={3\\\\over \\\\pi^2a}\\\\prod_{p|a}{p-1\\\\over p+1}\\\\cdot N(\\\\log^2N+c_1(a) \\\\log N+c_0(a))+\\\\Delta(N;\\\\,a). $$ In this paper, we shall get a more explicit expression with better error term for $c_0(a)$. For a given autonomous time-dependent system that generates either a global, in time, semigroup or else only a local, in time, semigroup, a test involving a linear eigenvalue problem is given which determines which of \\'global\\' or \\'local\\' holds. Numerical examples are given. A linear transformation A is defined so that one has \\'global\\' or \\'local\\' depending on whether A does not or does have a positive eigenvalue. There is a possible application to Navier-Stokes problems. We consider a new integral representation for $L(s_1, \\\\Pi \\\\times \\\\tau_1) L(s_2, \\\\Pi \\\\times \\\\tau_2),$ where $\\\\Pi$ is a globally generic cuspidal representation of $GSp_4,$ and $\\\\tau_1$ and $\\\\tau_2$ are two cuspidal representations of $GL_2$ having the same central character. As and application, we find a new period condition for two such $L$ functions to have a pole simultaneously. This points to an intriguing connection between a Fourier coefficient of a residual representation on $GSO(12)$ and a theta function on $\\\\widetilde{Sp}(16).$ A similar integral on $GSO(18)$ fails to unfold completely, but in a way that provides further evidence of a connection. A sequence $A$ of elements an additive group $G$ is {\\\\it incomplete} if there exists a group element that {\\\\it can not} be expressed as a sum of elements from $A$. The study of incomplete sequences is a popular topic in combinatorial number theory. However, the structure of incomplete sequences is still far from being understood, even in basic groups. The main goal of this paper is to give a characterization of incomplete sequences in the vector space $F_p^d$, where $d$ is a fixed integer and $p$ is a large prime. As an application, we give a new proof for a recent result by Gao-Ruzsa-Thangadurai on the Olson\\'s constant of $\\\\F_p^2$ and partially answer their conjecture concerning $F_p^3$. '"
